Spark said that global banks HSBC and Citigroup will be participating in Spark’s Series B funding round, which has so far raised $16.5 million over two tranches. OSK Ventures International Bhd., a Kuala Lumpur-based investment firm, also joined the current round, which was done at a valuation of just over $70 million according to Spark Systems’ CEO Wong Joo Seng. HSBC, Citi and OSK join Goldman Sachs as investors in the company. Mr. Wong stated that the funds raised will be sufficient for the next three and a half years of operations and growth, although more investors will likely participate in the current round later this year. Wong Joo Seng, Spark Systems According to Mr. Wong “trading started to surge into late February just as the contagion spread.” Singapore has become the world’s third leading FX trading hub behind only London and New York. According to BIS data, Singapore-based FX trading volume accounts for roughly 10% of the $6 trillion plus of daily global activity in the currency markets. Spark currently provides clients with prices from global banks which have pricing systems set up in Singapore. “We are executing in Singapore on a one to two millisecond time basis,” Mr. Wong said, noting that executions in London or New York could take on the order of 380 milliseconds, so the time savings from the regional operation is substantial. Spark apparently recorded an average $5.5 billion-a-day trading volume during Q1-2020, up from $2.5 billion during the same period in 2019. But the slowing global economy is now starting to dampen activity in the second quarter, Mr. Wong said, with average trading volume sliding to $4.5 billion to $5 billion a day. “If you have GDP shrinking, if you have numerous companies that are badly affected, it will affect the level of economic activity and the amount of forex being traded,” he said. The vast majority of the firm’s trades currently involve Group-of-Ten assets, but Mr. Wong said that Spark sees opportunities for the firm to boost its capabilities in emerging-market currencies such as the Korean won, Chinese yuan, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah. “We see Singapore as a very natural hub for corporate treasury and for emerging market currencies price discovery,” he said. “We’d like to be the center where that is being traded.”"

The announcement indicated that Exinity will comprise the various retail businesses owned by Dashin which includes Alpari International, ForexTime (FXTM) and its soon-to-be-launched new retail offering under the Exinity name. Mr. Dashin has named one of his longtime lieutenants, Olga Rybalkina, as Exinity Group’s Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Rybalkina has been acting as CEO of Dashin’s Cyprus-based FXTM brand for the past few years. Dashin noted that the new identity reflects the group’s next phase of fintech evolution and expanded purpose: to give millennials in emerging markets the ‘Freedom to Succeed’. The move comes as a number of new online brokerage brands have launched catering specifically to younger traders. US based examples include Robinhood, Public.com, Webull and All of Us, while Australian startup Stake, which is also now targeting the UK, recently hit 100,000 users. These brands, as looks like will be the case with Exinity, have a much more mobile app focus than most of their “older” competitors, catering to a younger generation. So not surprisingly, Exinity’s founders said that they intend to launch an innovative new mobile trading and investing app in early 2021 that will allow its customers to build their own investment portfolios across a wide range of asset classes on both cash and leveraged basis. Andrey Dashin Mr. Dashin called the new chapter in the Group’s evolution: “an important milestone driving our business to further innovate, grow and expand globally to better serve current and new customers. Considering millennials will soon be the global economy’s dominant force, particularly across emerging markets, we see huge potential in providing them with greater access to financial markets. Exinity’s vision is to address the needs of this new generation, building on our more than 20-year legacy in trading and investing serving over three million clients across 180 countries.” Mr. Dashin’s retail FX exploits have been fairly successful dating back to the late 1990s when his Alpari brand was one of the first brokerages to make it big using MetaQuotes’ MT4 trading platform. However his empire has hit a few road blocks over the years. The group’s FCA-licensed entity Alpari UK went bankrupt in the Swiss Franc spike crisis of 2015, although most if not all of Alpari UK’s clients eventually got their money back. And the company, which was one of the first Retail FX brokers to receive a Bank of Russia FX license, had that license suspended in late 2018, and the brand now operates as an offshore Saint Vincent and the Grenadines company."

And, most (if not all) of them are being decided in favor of the brokers. Nobody foresaw what would happen that day, as the Swiss National Bank (the country’s defacto central banking authority) surprisingly reversed course and announced that they would no longer be holding down the value of the Swiss Franc versus the Euro. That sent the Franc instantly soaring – by how much exactly remains a mystery, but in the 25-40% range – before settling up about 20% on the day, effectively moving from roughly par with the US Dollar to par with the Euro. However that one-time step function move up early in the day wiped out many traders who were short the Franc versus the EUR or USD (or anything else), especially traders using leverage as many FX traders do. And, it left a large hole in the pockets of many FX dealers, and not just B-book brokers – they had to pay the big wins of those clients fortunate enough to be long CHF, but could not collect from those clients short the CHF using leverage. A number of well known retail FX brokers went bust from the effects of that one event, including Alpari UK and LQD Markets, while FXCM narrowly avoided bankruptcy by engineering a life-saving loan from Leucadia (now Jefferies Financial Group), which gave Jefferies effective control of the company. Well that same FXCM was victorious in a lawsuit brought against the company by one of its former clients, Target Rich International Ltd. Yesterday, a UK judge dismissed Target Rich’s lawsuit against FXCM. Target Rich was seeking to recoup more than $591,000 in losses from FXCM stemming from the Swiss Franc flash crash. Target Rich had a stop loss order in place which was not executed as planned – but again, stop loss orders are only really useful if the market moves in a straight line, not in a step-function “jump”. As reported by legal news site Law360, UK High Court Judge Adrian Beltrami QC ruled that FXCM had not acted negligently nor breached its contract with Target Rich by not executing the client’s stop loss order, which again would have exited the position at a better price. Law360 reported that Judge Beltrami wrote The “scope of the claim is limited to the case that FXCM was obliged to secure, yet failed to secure, the stop loss price…. I have rejected the existence of any such duty.” Judge Beltrami called the Swiss Franc surprise move a “force majeure,” which suspends certain obligations that FXCM had to its client under normal conditions. Target Rich’s suit against FXCM was brought in December 2018. The company said it believed that the trial held in the case earlier this month was actually the first to be completed on the legal consequences of the Swiss Franc flash event. However that might have been just the UK. Other such lawsuits stemming from the events of January 15, 2015 have already been brought against FX dealers (which as we noted above were also surprised by the SNB decision, and took heavy losses because of it), several of which were decided like this one in favor of the dealer although some (like one in Hungary brought against Danish broker Saxo Bank) were resolved in favor of the client."

For all of Fiscal 2020, Revenues at CMC Markets (which it calls “Net operating income”, or Gross Revenues from client trading less introducing partners commissions ) came in at £252 million – with the bulk of that, £149.7 million, coming in the second half of the year. Total profit for the year at CMC was £86.9 million, with £59.4 million of that in 2H-2020. To give our readers a good sense of just how much better the second half of the year was at CMC Markets (which we’ve also seen at a number of other Retail FX and CFD brokers), the following metric is key. In the first half of Fiscal 2020 (i.e. April-September 2019) average revenue per client at CMC Markets came in at £2,047. For the full year 2020 it was £3,750. Peter Cruddas CMC Markets founder, CEO and controlling shareholder Peter Cruddas had the following to say: “During these extraordinarily difficult times, I would like to take the opportunity to convey my sympathies to everyone who has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am extremely proud of the resilience and dedication shown by all of my colleagues at CMC, who are contributing to ensuring that our clients are able to trade throughout a period of extraordinarily high volume and volatility in global markets. The significant performance improvement in 2020 is a result of the Group’s unwavering focus on our strategic initiatives. This has delivered increased diversification of Group revenues, improved CFD client income retention and an increased number of active clients. The growing contribution of B2B revenues is also particularly pleasing and will continue to be an important part of our strategy going forward. The heightened volatility and trading activity resulting from COVID-19 has continued into the first quarter of the financial year, and CMC continue to provide clients with market leading trading platforms and client service. I am also confident that, once the financial world returns to more normal conditions, the Group will continue to build on the underlying growth that was being displayed prior to the pandemic. This, in combination with our stable dividend policy and positive trading outlook, will enable CMC to continue to deliver considerable value to all of our stakeholders.” The full release detailing CMC Market’s 2020 results can be seen here."

Plus500 shares actually fell by about 14% at the open yesterday, before recovering some of the losses. So what had Plus500 shareholders and traders in a knot? Plus500’s Trading Update was in our view one of the stranger ones we’ve seen of late. On the one hand, it was a glowing report of things going better than planned at Plus500, presenting metrics which would be the envy of many of its competitors. More than 100,000 new customers onboarded since the end of Q1, well ahead of expectations. Client deposit levels tripling since year-end 2019 to $488 million. And the company is on track to earn near-record Spread revenue from trading clients, $249 million in the first two months of the quarter. All in all a very rosy picture at Plus500. However the one pebble in the shoe in the report was that actual reported revenue so far in the quarter was $102 million, not $249 million. The difference? Profitable customer trades over (mainly) the first week in June ate into spread revenue to the tune of almost $150 million. Now normally customers making profitable trades should be a good thing for a broker. Even for a B-book broker such as Plus500, which takes the opposite side of clients trades. However it appears as though Plus500 was not hedging its client book, leading to the large loss for the company in early June. B-book brokers typically hope that clients’ trades offset. The trading volume at a firm such as Plus500 consists of a large number of (relatively) small trades by large numbers of clients. So, B-book brokers hope that for each client that longs the EURUSD (or S&P500 index, or Amazon CFDs, or Spot Gold….), there’s another client going short, and that way the broker is hedged. At least it is supposed to work in the aggregate, and it normally does. But on a week like last week when the market is moving in one direction (equities up up up, US Dollar down, crude oil up…) and clients all piling on in that one direction, the broker can be exposed. So, in most instances, the broker with a (heavily) unbalanced book goes outside and hedges those trades, just like a sports book would do if all its clients bet one side of a match. Many brokers actually automate that process. But apparently Plus500, either consciously or by accident, didn’t do that. (Most likely the former). The philosophy at many B-book brokers is that they may have a bad day or week once in a while, but overall there is a cost to hedging (i.e., giving up a good portion of client spread revenue to a third party) which just isn’t worth it since in the long run things will even out. Overall, it seems like traders in Plus500 stock were somewhat shocked by the size of the unhedged client gains – hence the 14% dip in LON:PLUS shares at the open – but quickly sobered up when they realized that this was likely a one-time thing, with Plus500 still being a fairly potent money making machine. And hence the recovery of most of the dip over the rest of yesterday’s trading session. Long term, revenues and profitability at retail FX brokers (whether A or B-book) tend to correlate strongly to client deposits, new clients acquired at a reasonable price, market volatility and client trading volumes. And all four of those still align quite nicely for Plus500."

UK financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which often issues warnings regarding clone or copycat websites of properly regulated companies it licenses, has announced that the FCA itself has been hit by a clone of sorts. The FCA issued a notice that a web domain has been set up at www.register-fca.org, which is a clone of the FCA’s financial services register. That is one of the more popular online services provided by the FCA, where anyone can search for information about FCA-licensed companies, people or products. (We here at FNG are frequent users of the site). The FCA stated that it is currently working to get the fake page taken down, but it appears to be up and running now as of the time of writing. One quick way to identify the fake site – which looks nearly identical to the FCA’s real register page at https://register.fca.org.uk/ – is that it isn’t SSL-enabled, such that it should appear as “Not Secure” in the address line of your web browser, as per above. The FCA’s site is “https” SSL enabled."

The FCA noted a number of transgressions made by each of the firms when it came to engaging with UK clients, most notably the use of unauthorised celebrity endorsements on social media as part of their marketing to UK clients, and the pressuring of clients into making trades. The firms hit by the FCA’s actions are: Hoch Capital Ltd (trading as iTrader and tradeATF), Magnum FX (Cyprus) Ltd (trading as ET Finance), Rodeler Ltd (trading as 24option), and F1Markets Ltd (trading as Investous, StrattonMarkets and Europrime) The orders require the firms to stop selling CFDs to UK customers, to close existing positions with UK customers, to return UK customers’ money and to notify UK customers of the FCA’s action. License passporting is a regime put in under EU MiFID rules, which allows a financial services company which is licensed/regulated in one EU country (such as Cyprus) to automatically offer its services in other EU countries, without the need to separately license with the other countries’ national regulators. As of now, license passporting will remain in place between EU countries and the UK even following Brexit. Each of the firms noted above are entitled to seek a review of the FCA’s action. The FCA stated that these firms used social media and webpages carrying fake endorsements from celebrities to entice consumers into the scams involving CFDs. The FCA estimates that UK investors have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds in these investments. None of the firms and their operators have any actual presence in the UK, and the firms have addresses in Cyprus. The FCA took action because consumers were not provided with sufficient information as to the nature of the investments, some were pressured into making increasingly large investments in CFDs, which referenced bitcoin, foreign exchange, shares and indices, and some were even encouraged to take out credit to make the payments. It also appears that the firms had failed to pay money owed to investors, charged customers undisclosed fees and failed to tell them about the risks of trading CFDs. CFDs are complex financial investments which allow traders to speculate on the movement in prices of underlying assets and can cause heavy losses to unwary or inexperienced investors. A number of customers are known to have lost more than £100,000 to the schemes. The Cypriot-regulated firms – which were permitted to operate in the UK through a method known as passporting – must now cease all regulated activities with UK consumers. It is the first time the FCA has used its power to remove passporting rights from a firm. Mark Steward, FCA Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said: “The FCA has removed passporting rights for these firms which effectively stops them from continuing to provide these types of products in the UK. We welcome the further action taken by the CySEC. The FCA’s investigations into the sector are continuing.” Following the FCA’s action, and on the basis of information supplied by the FCA, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has fully suspended the regulatory authorisations of Rodeler Ltd and Hoch Capital Ltd and partially suspended the regulatory authorisations of Magnum FX (Cyprus) Ltd and F1 Markets Ltd. The CySEC action means that Rodeler Ltd and Hoch Capital Ltd must cease all regulated activities entirely. Magnum FX (Cyprus) Ltd and F1 Markets Ltd, may only provide investment services to their existing non-UK-resident clients, and must not promote the provision of their investment services or take on new clients. They are also explicitly prohibited from providing investment services to existing or new UK resident clients"

Mr. Schulmeister was most recently senior affiliate manager for Eastern Europe for Cyprus-based broker BDSwiss.

In what will likely be its last quarterly financial report as an independent public company, Gain Capital reported that it brought in $101 million in Revenue, and generated $28.9 million of EBITDA and $14.3 million of net income in Q2-2020. That’s as compared to Revenue of $185.7 million, EBITDA of $114.4 million, and net income of $77.3 million in Q1. While Q1’s figures were clearly an aberration centered around a crazy amount of client trading activity in March at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, even with Q2’s reduced results as a base the company is about to be acquired by StoneX for about 2x run rate annual EBITDA, and 4x earnings. However prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and the market volatility which has come with it Gain Capital was barely treading water, posting large losses in 2019 (as the chart above demonstrates), leading to the decision to find a buyer for the company. Gain Capital CEO Glenn Stevens said of Q2: “A second quarter of high volatility, due in part to the ongoing economic concerns over the COVID-19 virus, allowed Gain to continue to benefit from high daily volumes, up 28% year on year, revenue capture of $150 plus improved operational leverage arising from a successful focus on cost efficiency over the past 2 years. Adjusted EBITDA was more than double the prior year’s at $29m, a margin of 29% compared to last year’s 17%, with adjusted EPS of $0.40 taking the half year to $2.48 earnings per share.” “Client metrics in the second quarter further improved over the strong first quarter, as 42% more clients placed their first trade compared to the first quarter, an increase of 141% over prior year. These new clients, together with increased engagement from the large client base who opened accounts with us in 2019, helped improved our 3-month trailing active accounts by 34% over last year to a new record level. In addition, we look forward to the closing of the acquisition by StoneX Group (formerly INTL FCStone Inc.), which remains on track to complete later this quarter.” Regarding the pending acquisition of the company for $236 million in cash by StoneX, all Gain had to say in its Q2 results filing was that the deal “remains on track to complete during the 3rd quarter of 2020.” Gain Capital’s full Q2-2020 results release can be seen here."

Moneta Markets (at monetamarkets.com) is a trademark of Vantage International Group Limited, the group’s licensed Cayman Islands subsidiary.

Moneta Markets is launching with Trading Central’s new AI-based TC Market Buzz. The company’s offshore status allows it to offer clients conditions such as leverage up to 500x, and a $200 minimum deposit.

The regulator suspended the AFS license of ForexCT at the beginning of June, citing a list of improper behavior towards clients carried out by ForexCT and its management. Since then, the only action taken by ASIC was the imposition of a three year ban on a ForexCT account manager, Steven Marsh. Well now it seems as if ASIC is going to ramp things up, beginning with a multi-million dollar lawsuit against both ForexCT and its sole director / shareholder, Shlomo Yoshai. We would note that these are civil proceedings, not criminal. Also, at least to date no regulatory action has been taken personally against Mr. Yoshai – the only regulatory ban so far has been issued against a former ForexCT account manager, as noted above. In its lawsuit seeking up to AUD $3.7 million in combined damages and penalties against ForexCT and Mr. Yoshai, ASIC pointed out what is calls a “system of unconscionable conduct” which included high pressure sales tactics, offering deposit bonuses to clients and other incentives to transfer more money to ForexCT, recommending trading strategies that were inappropriate to clients, and making false or misleading statements to clients. Overall, in a Wolf-of-Wall-Street comparison ASIC said that ForexCT under Mr. Yoshai’s influence implemented and encouraged a trading floor culture that was directed towards maximizing trading volume and client deposits, rather than promoting a culture of compliance with applicable legal requirements. ForexCT also put in disincentives for clients to withdraw funds from their trading accounts. Account managers were paid bonuses primarily based on client “net deposits,” that is total client deposits less withdrawals. We would note that this isn’t ASIC’s first action taken against Mr. Yoshai. In March of 2019 the regulator obtained a restraining order against ForexCT blocking the company from moving any money out of Australia, while also banning Mr. Yoshai from leaving the country. ForexCT’s Australia website remains up at forexct.com.au, but with a pop-up notice (see at left) indicating that the company is no longer accepting new customers. However it does appear as if the company and its shareholder are still operating the ForexCT brand offshore, from an unidentified location, at forexct.com. The full ASIC press release on the ForexCT lawsuit can be seen here."

Hormoz Faryar Mr. Faryar will serve as ADSS’s new Head of Institutional Sales, reporting to Global Head of Sales, Khaldoun Sharaiha. Mr. Sharaiha also re-joined ADSS earlier this year from Equiti Group, so it isn’t too much of a surprise that he brought Mr. Faryar back to ADSS soon after his appointment. Hormoz Faryar spent the last three years with ADSS rival Equiti Group, another UAE based retail forex broker with global aspirations. At Equiti he was also Head of Institutional Sales. Mr. Faryar had spent six years with ADSS in his previous stint with the company, joining in 2011 in sales and working his way up the ladder to become Head of Institutional Sales – Middle East & Africa, before leaving for Equiti as noted in 2017. Hormoz Faryar began his finance career with State Street in London with its then-new business unit FX Connect. After nine years at State Street he moved to Credit Suisse UK to take up the role of VP AES FX Sales. After two years at Credit Suisse he moved to the UAE to join ADSS, then known as ADS Securities. The move comes a few weeks after FNG exclusively reported that ADSS had made some other moves within its sales organization at HQ under Mr. Sharaiha’s new leadership, promoting both Omar Qaryouti and Ammar Bader to Sales Director in early June."

GO Markets has yet to name a replacement for Mr. Gore. Christopher Gore joined GO Markets more than a decade ago, in 2009, as a market analyst. He joined GO after serving as a forex market analyst for four years at IG Markets’ Australian operation. Mr. Gore worked his way up the ladder at GO Markets, being named a Director in 2013 and then promoted to CEO in 2017. Established in 2006, Melbourne based GO Markets is one of the leading licensed Retail FX and CFD brokers in Australia. We reported a few weeks ago that GO Markets has expanded recently in the MENA region, and obtained a Broker License from the UAE Securities & Commodities Authority (SCA). GO Markets’ subsidiary GO Markets Ltd is licensed by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). Mr. Gore posted the following to social media today: Today is my final day as CEO of GO Markets, so I thought it is perhaps appropriate that I give a quick shout-out to my team and acknowledge the help and support I’ve received over the last 11-years. We’ve grown a great business together. I look forward to seeing the company continue to grow from the sidelines. We have received the following statement from GO Markets on the matter: GO Markets announce departure of CEO, Christopher Gore Global derivatives provider GO Markets has announced that Christopher Gore will depart as Chief Executive Officer. MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – 21 July 2020 After 4 years at the helm and over a decade at the firm, Christopher Gore departs formally today. In a statement to staff, Director and CFO, Soyeb Rangwala thanked Christopher for his invaluable contribution to the company, “Chris has played a critical role in the growth, and success of GO Markets. His years of dedicated service to GO Markets involves many significant accomplishments and developments.” On his departure, Christopher said the partnership has been long and rewarding. “As a team, we’ve materially strengthened just about every business indicator over the last couple of years. I am proud to have presented the company over the years and I’ve made some life-long friends along the way. I think it’s the right time for me to handover and fly the GO Markets flag from the sidelines.” “Receiving the No.1 ranking for customer services, among other accolades in the recent Investment Trends report is perhaps a parting gift for me. But I’ve got a feeling there’s more milestones to come.” GO Markets will make a further announcement in due course relating to a new CEO.

The FCA licensed broker is seeing its shares trade up by about 6% to a 52-week high of just above £14 a share in early LSE trading, following the release this morning of Plus500’s first half trading update (see text below). In the update the company also confirmed interim CEO David Zruia (pictured above) as the company’s permanent CEO. Mr. Zruia had been COO of Plus500 since 2013, and was named interim CEO in April of this year following the departure of Asaf Elimelech. Back to the numbers, Plus500 reported that Q2 revenues came in at $247.6 million, which followed a record $317 million in Q1. As you can see in the following graph, Plus500 has quite a lot of variability in its quarterly top line, with revenues usually correlating highly to overall financial market volatility. As we noted above, although Q2 revenues came in 22% below Q1 it is being viewed as another strong quarter for Plus500, indeed one of its three-best ever. Fueling the market’s optimism about the future, Plus500 noted that it onboarded 115,225 new customers in Q2 2020, an absolutely staggering figure, at what the company called an “attractive cost”. The full text of Plus500’s Q2 / First Half 2020 Trading Update follows: 7 July 2020 Plus500 Ltd. Appointment of CEO and Half Year Trading Update Plus500, a leading technology platform for trading Contracts for Difference (“CFDs”) internationally, today issues the following trading update for the six months ended 30 June 2020, as well as the appointment of a permanent Chief Executive Officer.  Appointment of CEO Following an extensive internal and external search carried out by the Board, the Company announces that David Zruia has been appointed as permanent Chief Executive Officer, having held the role on an interim basis since 20 April 2020. David joined Plus500 in 2010 and was appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2013. Half Year Trading Update Further to the Company’s recent trading updates, issued on 28 April 2020 and 8 June 2020, market volatility remained heightened throughout the second quarter. This drove a consistently high level of customer trading activity which, together with the onboarding of a significant number of New Customers1 at an attractive cost, ensured a record number of Active Customers2 trading on the Plus500 platform during H1 2020. 198,176 New Customers were onboarded during H1 2020 (H1 2019: 47,540), including 115,225 New Customers in Q2 2020 (Q2 2019: 26,234). As a result, total revenue for H1 2020 was circa $564.2m3 (H1 2019: $148.0m), including circa $247.6m3 in Q2 2020 (Q2 2019: $94.1m), demonstrating the strength, scalability and differentiation of the Group’s business model. The Company achieved a record level of half yearly Customer Income4, of approximately $556.9m (H1 2019: $175.0m), including circa $323.4m in Q2 2020 (Q2 2019: $93.0m). Furthermore, the period-end position of Customer Trading Performance5 reverted to insignificant historical levels, with revenues from Customer Trading Performance representing approximately 1% of the total revenues in the period. The unprecedented market environment during the period, the consistently high level of quality and performance of Plus500’s market-leading proprietary technology platform and the continued dedication and hard work of our employees in extremely challenging circumstances ensured that customer retention remained strong. The Company’s financial position remains robust, driven by the strong EBITDA margin achieved during the period and continued high cash generation, as well as the minimal capital expenditure requirements and the low capital intensity of the business. Despite a background of on-going uncertainty regarding the duration of current levels of volatility, and the unquantified potential impact from regulatory changes in Australia, the Board remains very confident about the outlook for the Company. A further update will be provided when the Company publishes its half-year results for the six months ended 30 June 2020 on 11 August 2020. 1 New Customers – Customers depositing for the first time during the period 2 Active Customers – Customers who made at least one real money trade during the period   3 Unaudited numbers 4 Customer Income – Revenue from customer spreads and overnight charges 5 Customer Trading Performance – Gains/losses on customers’ trading positions Penny Judd, Chairman of Plus500, commented on David Zruia’s appointment as permanent CEO: “David has proven his ability over several years with Plus500 as Chief Operating Officer, during which time he has developed a thorough knowledge of the business and has consistently exhibited strong leadership skills. He quickly rose to the challenge of becoming interim CEO and, consequently, he proved to be the outstanding candidate to take on the role permanently, following an extensive internal and external search process carried out by the Board. The Board is looking forward to working with David in the future and we wish him the very best in leading Plus500 going forward.” David Zruia, Chief Executive Officer of Plus500, commented on his appointment and on the results: “Having been part of the Plus500 team for almost 10 years, I am honoured to be given the opportunity to become CEO of the Company. It has been exciting to lead the business on an interim basis over the last few months and I believe that Plus500 is in an extremely strong position, both operationally and financially, to deliver future growth for our shareholders. “This position is highlighted by our exceptionally strong performance during the first half of 2020. The significant number of New Customers on-boarded is a strong signal of the sophistication and accessibility of our proprietary technology platform. This performance is also a testament to our people, who have been fully committed to ensuring that we have offered our customers a consistent, seamless, high quality service in extremely challenging, and unprecedented, circumstances. “Given our performance in the first half, we remain very confident about the prospects for the Company.”"

The London based Ms. Collins had been with Gain Capital since 2016. From London, she oversaw the company’s global marketing campaigns and strategy for its Forex.com and City Index retail forex and CFD brokerage brands. She took on that role after Gain had promoted its former New York based CMO, Samantha Roady, to become President of Retail under CEO Glenn Stevens in early 2016. Wendy Collins’ departure seems to be coinciding with Gain Capital’s pending acquisition by US rival StoneX. After the acquisition, which is expected to close pending final regulatory approvals later in Q3, we understand that the marketing (and possibly other) functions of Forex.com and City Index will be centrally handled within StoneX, as part of that company’s plans to cut costs and streamline the two operations. Prior to joining Gain Capital Ms. Collins had spent a number of years in marketing for the gaming sector, first with Ladbrokes where she was Digital Director from 2010-2013, responsible for customer acquisition for Ladbrokes’ online, tablet and mobile Sportsbook, as well as its Casino, Games, Bingo and Poker lines. She was also Director of Customer Development for Ladbrokes retail, online, tablet and mobile channels across all products including the OddsOn! loyalty programme. Ms. Collins was then a consultant to the industry with Accio Consulting, serving clients such as Hibu, GeoLotto, and Scottish Children’s Lottery."

The company notes that about 70% of the trades that pass through Tickmill’s trading servers are initiated by trading algorithms and expert advisors (EAs). Commenting on the results, Mukid Chowdhury, Group CFO of Tickmill, said: “The progress made by Tickmill Group in 2019 demonstrates the continued improvements achieved across all areas of the business, from our marketing and branding initiatives through to a focus on first-class customer service and the innovations introduced on our technology and products. Despite some challenging trading conditions during 2019, these improvements have allowed Tickmill to continue to attract new clients and further expand its operations”. “We remain committed in continuing the investment towards the development of our people, products, and services, and to provide our clients with the service they expect in order to ensure that Tickmill is their provider of choice for their trading needs.

The new asset classes come with excellent trading conditions and are exclusive to the company’s MT5 platform. George Koumantaris HotForex CEO George Koumantaris said: “Every new product we offer is driven by our constant efforts to secure a better trading experience for our clients. With this addition to our list of 1000+ instruments we provide our clients with the opportunity to expand their trading activities and ensure they can access innovative and low cost investment products at all times.” With CFDs on DMA stocks HotForex said that traders can benefit from direct market live pricing. Unlike CFDs on stocks, which are not directly hedged in the underlying physical market, a CFD on DMA stocks means that HotForex will allow you to view and trade with the live order books of global stocks regulated exchanges. However, as with all CFD products, you will trade a CFD and not gain ownership rights of the stock you wish to trade. Trading CFDs on DMA stocks allows you to see your order being directly reflected in the underlying physical market. An ETF is a basket of related assets that can be traded on a stock market exchange, just like stocks. A key benefit of an ETF is that allows for portfolio diversification. HotForex stated that ETFs are an ideal way of investing in market sectors as a whole rather than in individual stocks. With CFDs on ETFs, HotForex noted that investors gain enhanced exposure to a diverse variety of markets with a single trade."

The company had plans to launch an FCA licensed institutional FX arm called Land Liquidity, but it seems that those plans (and the Land Liquidity website) have gone offline, at least for the time being. The UK company is part of Mr. Park’s global Land-FX brand, which includes the land-fx.com offshore site operated by Landprime Ltd. domiciled in St. Vincent and the Grenadines."

Unlike many of The FCA’s warnings which involve phantom companies or offshore entities from abroad, SOFX does seem to be a properly organized and incorporated UK entity – just operating without an FCA license. Regulatory filings show that the website is owned and operated by SO FX Limited (UK company number 11249233) which was set up in 2018. SO FX Limited has three directors – Jack Kingsnorth, George Linfield, and Max Strode-Gibbons, all UK residents. George Linfield and his Lamborghini SO-FX seems to do much of its marketing and business on social media. The company’s Instagram account has more than 30,000 followers, while co-owner George Linfield’s Instagram has 22,900 followers, to whom he frequently posts pictures of his purple Lamborghini. SOFX’s Facebook page has more than 17,000 followers, and on Twitter more than 7,500. On its social media accounts the company called itself “the UK’s leading Forex education provider… learn a skill for financial freedom.” The company’s posts on social media include statements such as: If our complete beginners can make realistic profits, why can’t you? Who caught this move of over 250 pips and rode the wave from our live podcast last month? Ready to become a PRO advanced forex trader?… Enroll into our newly developed advanced course… 11.25% Profit in the last month on the SO Capital Trade Copier… +500 pips banked for the week… Another day, another 122 pips banked The SOFX website lists courses for both Beginner and Advanced traders, costing from £399 up to £995. Interestingly, the company posts a pop-up on its website saying that it has become aware of fraudsters replicating Instagram accounts of its staff, and as a result some members of the public are being scammed. The FCA stated that this firm is not authorised by it and is targeting people in the UK. Based upon information the regulator holds, it believes that SOFX is carrying on regulated activities which require authorisation. The FCA gave the following contact information for SOFX: Address: Roman Landing, 35-37 St Mary’s Place, Southampton SO14 1AU Telephone: 023 8017 8743, +4447771606768 Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/georgelinf/; @georgelinf; @sofx; https://m.facebook.com/sofxuk Website: https://so-fx.com The FCA stated to be aware that scammers may give out other false details or change their contact details over time to new email addresses, telephone numbers or physical addresses."

This marks the third consecutive year that EverFX is a Sevilla FC sponsor. The EverFX sponsorship does not include any real estate on players’ jerseys. Sevilla FC’s front-of-shirt sponsor is online bookmaker Marathonbet, which signed a two-year, reported €10 million agreement that began this past season. North American motor oil company Valvoline is Sevilla’s sleeve sponsor. Sevilla FC placed fourth in La Liga standings in 2019-20, and is one of Spain’s oldest and best known football clubs outside the large cities of Madrid and Barcelona. They are the current champions of the Europa League, and qualified to play in the pan-European Champions League in the coming 2020-21 season. Georgios Karoullas EverFX CEO Georgios Karoullas stated: “We are indeed very excited about the renewal with Sevilla for the third time! The collaboration has been excellent from the very beginning, and it’s amazing to have found a group of people with the same mentality and ethics.” “What started off as a collaboration between two entities with the same values, has evolved into something bigger than that. This feels more than just a sponsorship, and we feel very proud of Sevilla’s accomplishments. We are very happy to be part of this journey together!” EverFX is a trade name of CySEC regulated ICC Intercertus Capital Ltd."

In a year which has been anything but typical in the Retail FX trading world (or, anywhere else for that matter), the usual slowdown in trading activity during the summer months has failed to materialize, at least so far at Exness. The global forex broker has posted its July trading metrics indicating that the normally slow first full month of summer month was anything but. Total client trading volumes came in at $595.2 billion at Exness during July, up 27% over what was a fairly decent June. In fact, July was Exness’ second best month ever, topped only by March’s $785 billion, representing only the second time Exness monthly volumes have passed the $500 billion mark. We understand that July volumes were driven by a surge gold CFD trading, as gold prices continued a steady climb during the month to all time record levels. FNG spoke with Exness Chief Commercial Officer David Moyes, who had the following to say: “The current market volatility, more specifically with Gold, has definitely contributed to our increase in volumes to over $595 billion in July. This externality combined with our consistently increasing number of monthly active traders, which now stands at over 135,000 traders for the month of July, has driven trading volumes up to the second highest monthly record since the company was founded in 2008, with the highest being in March 2020, up 63% from the same time last year. We attribute this growth largely to our ability in providing our customers with the best trading experience possible in these challenging market conditions.” Exness also saw a record number of active clients during July at 135,424, up 5% from June’s 128,619. Exness has its client volumes, client withdrawal figures and agent commissions paid audited each quarter by Deloitte."

The sponsorship will cover the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. Plus500 replaces central European betting firm Fortuna as Legia Warsaw’s main sponsor. As noted above, the agreement with Legia Warsaw is in addition to Plus500’s existing sponsorships, including the longstanding and successful partnership as the main sponsor of Spanish football club Atlético Madrid, the recently announced partnership with Swiss league champ BSC Young Boys FC, and the sponsorship of the Plus500 Brumbies rugby club in Australia. Plus500 stated that its sponsorships of popular professional sports clubs have been highly successful to date, increasing global brand recognition, growing brand awareness in important local markets and expanding the company’s customer base in new and existing territories. As part of the Agreement, the Plus500 logo will feature on the front of the Legia Warsaw official jersey and training shirts for both national and overseas matches and gives Plus500 access to a range of branding rights. The agreement will initially run for two years from the 2020/21 season, with an option to extend for the 2022/23 season. Founded in 1916, Legia Warsaw FC is one of the most successful Polish football clubs in history, having won the country’s domestic league and cup competitions a record 14 and 19 times respectively. Based in Poland’s capital of Warsaw, the club will play in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League during the 2020/21 season. David Zruia David Zruia, Chief Executive Officer of Plus500, said: “We are delighted to be partnering with Legia Warsaw, a club with a great legacy and an excellent fan base, continuing our commitment to support professional sports and adding them to our already formidable bench of high-quality sponsorship agreements with national champions across the world. Our partnership with Legia is expected to further strengthen our ability to increase our international brand recognition and grow our global customer base, as well as driving brand awareness in Poland, an important market with great potential.” Dariusz Mioduski, Chief Executive Officer and owner of Legia Warsaw, said: “We are thrilled to announce this partnership with Plus500, a leading international company, as our main sponsor. We are proud that Plus500 has decided to partner with us in developing its market position in Poland and the region. This is an acknowledgment of the strength of the Legia Warsaw brand, the most successful football club and recognised sports brand in Poland.

Robinhood has somewhat revolutionized retail brokerage by offering commission free trading across a variety of instruments including stocks and options, and accelerating the use of the mobile phone as a main trading device. However the company has come under scrutiny for a variety of issues including having ill-prepared and educated traders doing very risky things, in large sizes. The company stated that its mission has been to bring opportunity, through technology, to help people invest, on their terms, on their mobile devices. Robinhood has introduced new access points to the markets and created space for people to learn about the financial world. The company pioneered commission-free trading, and was the first to do so for options. With its options trading experience, Robinhood stated that it aims to provide investors with an intuitive and cost-effective platform to trade options, which includes enhanced educational materials on options trading. It offers commission-free options trading alongside stocks and ETFs to help customers manage all of their investments in one place. The company noted that it is always working to make improvements in the product and to enhance communications to its customers. Over the last few months, it has been rolling out multiple updates to its Robinhood Options offering in an effort to deliver the best possible experience for customers. In-App Exercise and Instant Exercise Features Robinhood has added the ability to exercise contracts in the app. With in-app exercise, investors can exercise options contracts directly in the app to help avoid delays and trade restrictions. Funds and shares from exercises are available immediately during market hours. In designing this experience, the company said it has been deliberate about adding more safeguards and information. For example, before exercising an option, customers will be asked to review their strategy, associated risks, and potential reasons to not exercise the contracts, in order to help them determine whether exercise meets their objectives. The app also display alerts and available actions when exercising a contract. These features launched in the last few weeks and are fully rolled out to all options customers. Improvements to Early Assignment  Robinhood has recently revamped the early assignment experience to include new guidance to help with early assignment scenarios. It has built a resolution flow that will guide customers through the potential actions of exercising a contract or trading shares to resolve an account deficit, and added the ability to contact support directly through the app. These changes are rolling out to customers now. Additionally, the company rolled out changes to allow customers in certain cases to continue trading as soon as they take action on a potential restriction. It recently launched a self-service option to buy shares even if in a short position due to an early assignment. Previously, this was only possible by contacting support. Updates to Buying Power  Robinhood has begun rolling out improvements to how it shows buying power in the app. If customers have an account deficit, the app will display the deficit and help them understand the actions they can take to resolve it in different trading situations. Options Trading Education The company said it has revamped resources on its Help Center to add more clarity, including content around options strategies, advanced options strategies, and more information on topics like early options assignments. It also recently launched additional in-app messaging to help customers better understand the mechanics of early assignment, in which a customer trading a multi-leg options strategy has one leg of the position assigned for exercise prior to the expiration date. Robinhood also recently began rolling out a new onboarding experience to walk approved options customers through the foundations of an options spread before upgrading from Level 2 to Level 3 options trading. The company noted it has hired an Options Education Specialist who will join its team later this month and will continue to support these initiatives, as well as provide educational guidance and expertise in communication channels — from the website to social media to in-product. Additional Eligibility Criteria The company is rolling out new financial criteria and revised experience requirements for new customers seeking to trade Level 3 options strategies. Robinhood requires customers wishing to trade options to disclose, among other things, investment experience and knowledge, investment objectives, and financial information such as income. The company then conducts an assessment of this information in deciding whether a customer may be approved for options trading. Investing in and Growing Customer Support To ensure it continues to meet customers’ needs, Robinhood said it recently announced that it is hiring hundreds of new registered financial services representatives this year in Denver, Colorado, Southlake, Texas, and Tempe, Arizona. Across all of its locations it is adding new team members, including dedicated options support representatives, to help reduce response times, build more self-service tools, and enhance informational and educational tools. Its latest funding round valued still-private Robinhood at $11.2 billion."

RoboForex indicated that clients will not need to worry about unexpected power cuts or Internet connection failures. Clients’ subscribes and robots will work 24/7, even if MT5 is shut down on the PC. MetaQuotes VPS is selected for clients based on the proximity to the main server at the minimal ping; hence, network lagging in sending orders decreases.

Have a balance of no less than $500 USD at 00:00 server time on the first day of a new month.

The new license is an addition to the licenses that the entities within Equiti Group have from regulatory authorities in the UK, the UAE, Jordan, Kenya, and Armenia. lskandar Najjar Equiti Group CEO, Iskandar Najjar, said: “We are thrilled to be awarded our sixth financial services license. The FSA license is a significant milestone for Equiti Group and will support our future expansion into new regions such as Latin America and South-East Asia, as well as deliver new product offerings. “Regulatory compliance and strong business ethics are at the core of our operations. With the addition of our FSA license, our clients can be assured they are dealing with one of the most regulated and progressive global fintechs in the industry.” Other regulated subsidiaries within the Equiti Group include Equiti Capital UK Ltd, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), EGM Securities Ltd regulated by Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA), Equiti Group Limited Jordan LLC, regulated by the Jordan Securities Commission (JSC), EGM Futures DMCC, regulated by the UAE’s Securities Authority Commission (SCA) and Equiti AM CJSC regulated by the Central Bank of Armenia. In 2018, Equiti became the first specialised global brokerage to receive a license issued by the Jordan Securities Commission in over 10 years, and the first non-dealing online FX broker to be issued a license by Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority. A few months later, in April 2019, Equiti became the first regulated financial markets broker to open global trading opportunities to everyone in Kenya through the launch of FXPesa, an innovative mobile trading platform that allows anyone in Kenya with a smartphone, and who registers on the platform, to trade the global financial markets. The company noted that Equiti’s new FSA license is one of the group’s many achievements reported in 2020.

In June 2020, Equiti Group’s subsidiary, EGM Securities, signed its first partnership agreement with Genghis Capital, an investment bank in Kenya. This partnership allows the investment bank to extend its services to clients through a wider range of alternative asset classes offered by EGM Securities. Equiti has also expanded its global payment offering and is now able to offer clients an extensive range of payment options such as e-wallets, credit and debit cards, international bank transfers in 39 currencies, mobile money, virtual currencies, and an Equiti pre-paid card.

With the first past being, the brand will now be known just as “Axi”. Visitors to the firm’s old web address of axitrader.com are now rerouted to axi.com. The company also sports a new logo, with the letters “axi” all in lower case. Second, the newly minted Axi announced what amounts to the company’s first foray into international sports sponsorships. Axi said that it has inked a multi-year partnership with English Premier League club Manchester City FC. As noted this is the first major sports partnership for Axi and the company said it will help it create global awareness for its new tagline ‘Trade your edge‘ through high-profile placements within the Etihad Stadium, on the Man City website and also through activations with customers and fans online and at events with a range of exclusive offers and promotions. We would note that the new “Axi” logo will not appear on Manchester City jerseys. (City’s front-of-shirt sponsor is Etihad Airways). A number of larger Retail FX and CFD brokers have recently signed front-of-shirt, back-of-shirt, or sleeve deal sponsorships with leading European soccer clubs such as ICM.com-Newcastle United, Samtrade FX-Cardiff City, eToro-AS Monaco, Plus500-Atalanta, Plus500-Legia Warsaw, and Plus500-BSC Young Boys FC. Switzerland based Swissquote sponsors City crosstown rival ManU. Rajesh Yohannan, CEO at Axi said: “We have introduced a lot of innovation over the past few years – a more robust platform and a wider range of products for our clients around the world. This rebrand to Axi reflects our continuing efforts to deliver the trading edge for every trader.” Louis Cooper, Chief Commercial Officer at Axi said: “At the core of Axi is the vision to enable every trader to ‘Trade your edge’. And we believe that as we expand to more regions, more traders can benefit from our wide range of trading products and services.” Regarding the partnership with Manchester City, Mr. Cooper said: “As we started looking into relaunching our brand, we felt there were lots of similarities with how the world’s leading football clubs are focused around gaining that competitive edge and Manchester City personified that.” He added, “The refresh of the Axi brand and the partnership with Manchester City is part of our strategy to make our brand, award-winning services and product portfolio more accessible to more traders across the 100+ countries we operate in.” And third, coinciding with the rebrand and new Axi name is the launch of what the company calls Axi Select, an incubation program designed to provide talented retail traders with an equal opportunity to become full-time professional traders. To date, Axi Select has allocated over A$10 million to traders who have entered the program. Under this unique program, Axi provides retail traders with the necessary tools – including an Artificial Intelligence-backed performance analysis platform called PsyQuation – plus the funding to get them on the path to professional trading. Axi Select is at the core of Axi’s offering and one of the major components in the new brand’s message of ‘trading your edge’."

Back in June, we reported that IG had redone its longstanding logo, and upgraded its website. The rebranding had (and has) a lot to do with IG’s move to mobile, and the generally increasing use of mobile devices by retail traders when it comes to online financial trading. That move has certainly accelerated over the past few months, with the growing popularity of app based trading platforms such as Robinhood and Public.com in the US and NAGA Group in Europe. Now, FNG has learned that IG is getting ready to launch a few new ad campaigns. The center campaign is titled: See It, IG It. The See It IG It lead video follows: In addition, IG is going to launch video campaigns targeting mobile users. Here is the lead video for Android phone users. (There is a parallel ad for iOS device users as well). These ads will be targeted only at users on mobile devices. The campaigns are clearly targeting IG’s core client demographic globally, which is typically (but not exclusively) male, aged between 30 to 50, living in financial cities, wealthy, well-educated in trading markets and usually in professional or technical jobs. Gerhard Sagat FNG spoke with Gerhard Sagat, Head of Brand at IG, who had the following to say about the new campaign: “The main focus is around opportunity in our campaign. We are putting our clients at the centre of that so they know IG allows them to take advantage of all these opportunities.” “The advert is about building global brand awareness that serves our new strategy. The campaign we have launched is publicly taking this brand to the market.” Sources have informed FNG that the global campaign runs across the Middle East, Australia, the US, Asia Pacific, Europe and through to the UK. The advertising campaign will land in 21 markets globally coordinated across global business TV channels, online media, film, digital, outdoor advertising and also print media. We expect to hear (and see) more from IG in the coming days and weeks. The past few months have been record setting for leading Retail FX and CFD brokers when it comes to new client acquisition, with brokers reporting record trading volumes and results. Now, it looks like some of those returns are being plowed back into marketing and continuing to bring on board a new generation of experienced financial traders."

Maxi EFX operated the EuropeFX brand in Australia, and acted as a Corporate Authorised Representative of now-bankrupt Union Standard International Group Pty Ltd, which operated the USGFX brand down under. Maxi EFX was controlled by Israeli businessman Roy Almagor, who controls CySEC licensed Maxiflex Ltd, which operates the europefx.com website. ASIC had issued the notice to Maxi EFX in the course of an ongoing investigation into suspected contraventions of the ASIC Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001, which ASIC disclosed in December 2019. The regulator said that Maxi EFX failed to produce certain documents required under the notice, arguing that the notice was unclear, that ASIC was not entitled to seek such a broad range of documents and that certain documents were in the possession of overseas third party entities. Following this failure, ASIC applied to the Federal Court seeking an order compelling Maxi EFX to properly comply with the notice. Justice Andrew Wigney of Federal Court of Australia held that the notice was validly issued and that the documents requested by the notice were in the possession, custody or control of Maxi EFX, notwithstanding the fact that they may have been physically retained by third party entities located overseas. Justice Wigney determined that these entities held the documents “on behalf of, or on account of” Maxi EFX, which was in a position to request or require them to provide those documents to it so that they could be produced to ASIC. His Honour noted that the notice sought production of a large number of documents and that this did not mean that the notice was too broad. A notice issued under under section 33 of the ASIC Act is not like a subpoena or discovery in litigation and cannot be objected to on the grounds that it involves a “fishing expedition”. Justice Wigney also rejected the Maxi EFX argument that the notice was invalid because it did not convey with sufficient clarity the documents required to be produced, noting that the mere use of expressions such as “relating to” or “referring to” does not mean that a notice lacks sufficient clarity or precision. In determining that Maxi EFX did not have a reasonable excuse for its non-compliance, His Honour noted that “…it is tolerably clear that mere inconvenience and expense would not ordinarily provide a reasonable excuse for non-compliance.” The court’s decision in the Maxi EFX case can be seen here."

The report, Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features, was compiled by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank and the BIS, and highlights three key principles for a CBDC: Coexistence with cash and other types of money in a flexible and innovative payment system. Any introduction should support wider policy objectives and do no harm to monetary and financial stability. Features should promote innovation and efficiency. Let’s note that the report is more of an exploration and does not imply that the central banks in this group are actively considering issuance. CBDC issuance and design remains a sovereign decision for each jurisdiction based on an assessment of how CBDC could support public policy objectives through the provision of a safe means of payment. The potential financial stability implications of CBDC need to be considered carefully. There are two main concerns: in times of financial crisis, the existence of a CBDC could enable larger and faster bank runs; and more generally, that a shift from retail deposits into CBDC (“disintermediation”) could lead banks to rely on more expensive and less stable sources of funding. The report explains that these risks are inherent in making a safe central bank money available to the public (a central purpose of a CBDC) and are already present with the existence of cash, although a CBDC could bring new structural challenges. Before launching a CBDC, a central bank would need to make an informed judgment that risks were identified and would remain manageable. CBDC may offer opportunities that are not possible with cash. A convenient and accessible CBDC could serve as an alternative to potentially unsafe forms of private money, offer users privacy, reduce illegal activity, facilitate fiscal transfers and/or enable “programmable money”, according to the report. However, these opportunities may involve trade-offs and unless these have a bearing on a central bank’s mandate (eg through threatening confidence in the currency), they will be secondary motivations for central banks. Introducing a CBDC could have financial stability implications that would need to be assessed and managed carefully, the report warns. These include first, the potential for digital bank runs in times of stress and second, longer-term consequences for bank funding. While system-wide bank runs into cash are now very rare, given deposit insurance and bank resolution frameworks, there is the possibility that a widely available CBDC could make these events more frequent and severe, by enabling “digital runs” towards the central bank with greater speed and scale than is possible with cash. Another set of concerns is that the introduction of a CBDC could erode banks’ retail deposits, resulting in a less stable funding mix. Hence, the importance of establishing a legal framework that will underpin CBDCs."

The new entity, aptly named IG International Limited, received a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) earlier this year and has already been operating for several months. It will focus on accepting ”rest of world” clients for IG – that is, clients from jurisdictions and countries where IG does not have an existing licensed operation. That would include areas such as Central and South America, and certain regions in Africa and the Far East. The BMA license is a “Class F” license, allowing IG International to operate as a digital asset derivative exchange provider. IG International is permitted to deal in investments, arrange deals in investments, and safeguard and administer investments, but is not permitted to manage investments or provide investment advice. FNG spoke with an official IG spokesperson on the matter, who told us: “Our investment for growth in IG International means we are better positioned to capture further international client demand and simplifies the interactions of our existing international clients with IG. The opening of our international entity in Bermuda in March of this year has reduced our operational risk and seamlessly delivered the world-class trading experience all our clients expect.” The move by IG is one we have seen by other brokers such as VantageFX, GO Markets, and Equiti Group, setting up co- or differently-branded offshore entities for rest-of-world clients. As regulators in the US, Japan, the UK, the EU and most recently Australia have moved to place restrictive conditions on FX and CFD trading – leverage limits, required negative balance protection, outlawing deposit bonus payments, increased capital requirements – brokers which used to take rest-of-world clients onshore into their home base licensed entities are now switching to keeping them offshore, where they can still offer clients more lenient trading conditions. This also enables the “regulated” brokers such as IG to compete for rest-of-world clients with fully offshore brokers. We understand that IG chose Bermuda for a number of reasons. First, IG apparently wanted to bring all its international clients into a single entity under one regulator to reduce operational risk. Bermuda is different from most other “offshore” island nations in that it is recognized as having a strong regulatory framework for financial institutions through the BMA. Bermuda already regulates some of the world’s largest insurance companies and some other financial service providers, for example the international entities of AXA, Fidelity International, Allianz, AON, CHUBB, AIG, Marsh, and HSBC. A number of new-age cryptocurrency exchanges have also chosen to domicile in Bermuda for similar reasons, including CrossTower and FastMatch founder Dmitri Galinov’s 24 Exchange. And, location-wise Bermuda’s time zone is close to those of most of Central and South America, one of the key targets for IG International. We understand that IG International doesn’t offer products or services, either to residents of the UK or any EU country, or residents of countries where IG already has a local presence. It also doesn’t offer services to on-island residents of Bermuda. IG Group recently undertook a rebranding of its logo and website, launching a See it IG it campaign."

The Guru-ETX deal was first announced in early June. The parties did not disclose the price paid for ETX. ETX did £32.2 million (USD $40 million) in Revenue in 2018 with profit coming in at £1.9 million, both figures fairly flat as compared to the previous year. The company has yet to report 2019 results. ETX Capital, operated by FCA regulated Monecor (London) Limited, is a leading Retail FX and CFD broker. And, as was exclusively reported by FNG last month, has also branched out into capital raising and investment banking services for mid and small cap companies. The transaction is closing after receiving approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Additionally, Guru Capital partners Luca Merolla and Ryan Nettles have been appointed as non-executive directors to the ETX Capital Board of Directors. Founded in 1965, ETX Capital has become one of the UK’s leading online brokers. Guru Capital said that it intends to leverage the strong ETX Capital brand, its proprietary technology and its talented team to expand the business in the UK. The team also intends to grow the business globally through M&A activities."

After we exclusively reported last month that BlackRock had sold down its long-held position in shares of Plus500, FNG has learned via regulatory filings that the American investment giant has now also sold out of nearly half of its holdings in Plus500 rival IG Group. BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager with more than $6.8 trillion under management – has long been one of IG Group’s largest shareholders, keeping its holdings in IG at or around the 10% mark for the past three years. Regulatory filings made in the UK now indicate that last week BlackRock sold down its position from 9.84% to 5.05%. Based on the current IG share price (LON:IGG), that would mean that BlackRock sold about £139 million (USD $181 million) worth of shares last week, leaving its remaining IG holdings worth about £147 million (USD $191 million). IG shares have gone on a very boom and bust and boom roller coaster ride over the past 5 years, so it is unclear exactly how BlackRock has done on its investment in IG. At 753p per share IG isn’t too far off from its all-time high of 955p set in mid 2016 – but on the flipside IG hasn’t ventured below 500p for very long either during that period. (With Plus500 we reported that BlackRock was under water with its investment until Plus500’s recent share price surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing it basically back to even. Frankly, we think that the same is about correct with its IG holdings as well). IG Group share price graph, past 5 years. Source: Google Finance."

Royal recently rebranded its global operations under its new brand name at oneroyal.com. Before the re-brand, the company had been known as rfxt.com since 2006. Since the re-brand, fraudulent sites in Asia, and particularly Hong Kong, have been targeting the company. These scam sites use Royal’s logo, branding, and often a replica of the company’s website oneroyal.com, to potentially trick traders into making deposits they cannot later withdraw. Royal said it prioritizes the safety and security of its online traders. The company recently alerted all its traders and partners of these recent developments, asking them to stay alert. New unregulated scam forex brokers are emerging almost daily, promoting fraudulent services under well-established and trusted brand names. Royal has operated within a strong and secure corporate governance framework for close to 15 years.  It is regulated under CySEC, ASIC, VFSC, CMA and registered under FSA. The company has also grown exponentially over the years. This success has likely made it a recent target for illegal operations looking to capitalize on the trusted Royal brand. Andrew Taylor, Royal CEO noted: “During these times being extra vigilant pays. We value the reputation we’ve built with our traders and partners, and we take full responsibility to protect them very seriously.” Royal reminds traders and partners that its website address is www.oneroyal.com. The company has notified the authorities and has taken immediate steps to shut down these scam websites. It said that it will continue to take every measure necessary to safeguard the rights and safety of its traders and partners."

The decision put out by CySEC on the matter (see full text below) is fairly vague, but hints at issues including proper organization of the company, conflicts of interest, and information to clients. Roinvesting.com is a sponsor of Serie A team AC Milan, and the club’s Official CFD Partner, until June 30, 2021. We view this as the latest in a series of moves by the Cypriot regulator to “clean up” the Retail FX business which flourishes on the EU island state. Other recent fines handed out by CySEC include to FXGM, Libertex, 24option, Tradernet, OffersFX, and FINFXPRO.

A settlement has been reached with the CIF Royal Forex Ltd (“the Company”) for possible violations of The Investment Services and Activities and Regulated Markets Law of 2017 (“the Law”). More specifically, the settlement reached involved assessing the Company’s compliance for the period January 2018 until December 2019, following information on August 2018 and after an onsite inspection on March 2019, with regard tο: 1. Article 5(1) of the Law regarding the requirement for CIF authorisation. 2. Article 22(1) of the Law as to the authorisation conditions of articles 17(2) and 17(5)(a) of the Law, regarding the organisational requirements with which a CIF is required to comply. 3. Article 24 of the Law regarding conflicts of interest. 4. Articles 25(1) and 25(3) of the Law regarding the general principles and information to clients. The settlement reached with the Company, for the possible violations, is for the amount of €270.000, which the Company has already paid. It is noted that the amounts due to settlement agreements are calculated as revenue (income) to the Treasury of the Republic and do not constitute income of CySEC."

On October 23, 2020, the Government submitted a notice at the Arizona District Court, revealing that it plans to use expert witness testimony of Scott Holt, Forensic Accountant. The Government notes that the indictment charges 17 counts against Caruso, also known as Kryp+0 K!ng, and 12 counts against Salter. These charges include conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering. Further, the indictment alleges a fraudulent scheme involving millions of dollars flowing through the defendants’ bank accounts. The evidence in this matter includes thousands of pages of bank and financial records. Mr Holt is expected to testify regarding his analysis of these financial records. Based on Mr Holt’s analysis of the financial records to date, it is expected that he will testify that none of the investor deposits at issue in this case were used to purchase cryptocurrency investment funds or other “blockchain based assets.” Let’s recall that Caruso and Salter were both arrested on January 30, 2020, and charged by criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. The Indictment alleges that the duo operated purported cryptocurrency investment fund Zima Digital Assets. The scheme, in reality, was a fraud. Caruso and Salter gt more than $9 million from the victims but the money was not used for the purchase of cryptocurrency or other “blockchain based assets”. In fact, Caruso and Salter returned about $2 million of the deposits to early investors as purported investment profits. The rest of the money they spent on private jets, vacations, luxury car rentals, and casino gambling. Bank records and casino records establish that Caruso has lived an extravagant lifestyle since June 2018. During this relatively short period, he took 30 trips to Las Vegas. The Indictment notes a series of misrepresentations used by the defendants, including false statements in the contracts with the investors and false claims in direct messages to investors."

The IC Markets-Inter Milan sponsorship deal, signed in June of this year and reported exclusively at FNG (with an update on terms of the transaction also reported exclusively at FNG later in the summer), was to make IC Markets the “sleeve sponsor” of Inter Milan over a three-year period starting with the current 2020-21 season. The deal was going to see IC Markets paying €4.5 million in year one, €4.8 million in year two, and €5.0 million – totaling €14.3 million. There may have been additional bonus payments to be made to Inter, depending upon team results over the course of the sponsorship. The deal as reported would have been the biggest sleeve sponsorship to date among Serie A teams. Italian sports business site Calcio e Finanza is now reporting that Inter Milan cancelled the contract with IC Markets, citing that the sponsor (IC Markets) failed to comply with its contractual payment obligations. Inter apparently claims that IC Markets made an initial deposit on the agreement (€2.5 million), but did not follow up with next payments as required by the agreement between the two parties. IC Markets then sued Inter Milan, for reimbursement of the €2.5 million already paid in addition to interest. There is a first hearing on the matter scheduled before the Milan court for April 14, 2021. Sports sponsorships – and in particular those involving top drawer European soccer clubs with global appeal such as Inter Milan – have become an increasingly important marketing and branding tool for Retail FX brokers. Just over the past few months we have reported on such sponsorships including GO Markets-Chelsea, Axi-Manchester City, XTB.com-Jose Mourinho, ICM.com-Newcastle United, Samtrade FX-Cardiff City, eToro-AS Monaco, Plus500-Atalanta, Plus500-Legia Warsaw, Libertex-Tottenham Hotspur, easyMarkets-Real Madrid, Scope Markets-West Ham United, and Plus500-BSC Young Boys FC."

Grey markets enable traders to get exposure to a company before it lists on a stock exchange. When you decide to trade the grey market, you’re trading on the estimated market valuation of a company. The final valuation will only be known after the first day of trading – and it is based on the demand shown by the market that day. With the Robinhood grey market, traders would: ‘Buy’ if they think the market cap will be higher than the price indicated; ‘Sell’ if they think the market cap will be lower than the price indicated. There is a difference between trading in Robinhood shares and investing in Robinhood shares. When trading Robinhood shares with IG, you’ll use spread bets or CFDs to speculate on the stock’s future price movements. You will not take ownership of the underlying assets when trading, which means you can speculate on both rising and falling prices, and get various tax benefits. When investing in Robinhood shares via IG, you’ll use a share dealing account or tax-efficient ISA. You’ll pay the full value of your investment upfront, taking ownership of the underlying asset. You’ll profit if the share price goes up or if the company chooses to pay dividends. The Robinhood IPO could take places as early as the first quarter of 2021, as it has been reported that the company is seeking bank advisors. However, the company has not yet publicly confirmed its timeline or presented a public filing. Given the number of issues the company has faced recently – power outages and fraud investigations – Robinhood could choose not to list yet. The market Settles basis the market capitalisation of Robinhood at the official close of the primary exchange on the first day of unconditional trading excluding any outstanding and optional shares.

CMC reported revenues of £230.9 million for the period and net income of £110.8 million – both by far records for the company. To put things in perspective, CMC 6-month revenues had never crossed the £100 million line – mind you the £200 million mark – before 2020. And its bottom line net profit so far this year surpassed even its greatest revenue result before 2020. Another note we’d make is that these results don’t include March 2020, which was a one-time event for many online brokers that saw tremendous trading volumes in the first few weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak as financial markets went wild. It does seem as if CMC has been able to sustain a higher level of activity and profitability following that month. CMC saw strong performance across all business lines, and geographies. Active client numbers are way up. Its UK home market accounted for just 33% of CFD and spread betting revenue as the company experienced more than 100% YoY growth in continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. On the product side of things, CMC’s continued focus on its B2B business – providing white labels, liquidity, and other services to smaller brokers around the globe – also paid dividends, with B2B revenues hitting a record £38.9 million in 1H-2021. As noted above, CMC shares reacted this morning by trading up to as high as 418.25p, before settling back down somewhat to sit at 388.42 as at the time of writing. We would have expected an even bigger pop in CMC shares, except that the company somewhat telegraphed the good results already in its CMC Trading Update early last month, and the shares had traded up to near-record levels in the weeks since. CMC Markets shares, past six months. Source: Google Finance. At its current share price, CMC Markets has a valuation just north of £1.1 billion (USD $1.5 billion). Peter Cruddas, controlling shareholder and longtime CMC CEO commented on 1H-2021 as follows: “I am delighted with our record first half performance, which vindicates our strategy of continuing focus on high value clients. I am tremendously proud of the resilience, flexibility and capability displayed by all of my colleagues at CMC, and would like to personally thank them all for their commitment and passion with which they deliver the continued quality service to our clients. At CMC our goal is to constantly provide a superior and unrivalled online trading experience for our clients and through this period of market uncertainty we have provided a CFD platform with 99.97% uptime. We look to lead with quality and in the period have been able to on-board a record number of high quality clients and deliver significant growth across all of our key businesses. The significant increase in net trading revenue across all areas of the business in H1 2021 is a result of the Group’s unwavering focus on our strategic initiatives. This has delivered increased diversification of Group revenues, improved CFD client income and an increased number of active clients. During the period we continued to recruit new staff, we did not request to participate in any Government financial support schemes and all staff were paid in full through the normal payroll. Our new Chief Technology Officer, Brendan Foxen, has settled in well and is already making a valuable contribution. Looking ahead, while it is still too early to know the full extent of the changes in client trading demand, we have had the ability to demonstrate the strength of our offering and are confident in retaining the high-quality clients we target. I believe that CMC is in an excellent position. We have many opportunities to leverage our technological innovation, quality client service and platform strength, and these will allow us to expand our product portfolio and deliver further profitable growth for the Group. I believe that, based on these competitive advantages, we will be able to provide highly attractive returns for our shareholders over the coming years.”"

A group of plaintiffs suing a raft of major banks for FX market manipulation have now expanded the scope of the lawsuit (at least in terms of discovery). On November 6, 2020, Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the New York Southern District Court granted a motion for issuance of a Hague Convention Request for International Judicial Assistance to Take Testimony Overseas. FX News Group has examined a raft of documents associated with this request and has learnt that it concerns the testimony of Carly Hosler, a former Director of the FX Spot Trading Desk at Citigroup, a position located in London. The New York Southern District Court seeks the assistance of the appropriate judicial authority of England for obtaining evidence to be used at trial. The plaintiffs in this case allege that the defendants, including Citigroup, conspired to fix FX prices and otherwise manipulate the FX market from a period beginning at least as early as January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2013, in violation of U.S. antitrust and commodities exchange laws. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the defendants’ agreement encompassed: (a) improperly sharing confidential client and trading information, including prices; (b) front running client orders; (c) triggering of contingent FX contracts; (d) coordinating or manipulating bid/ask spreads quoted to customers; and (e) manipulating FX benchmark rates, such as the WM/Reuters and ECB benchmark rates. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants used electronic chat rooms with evocative names such as “The Cartel,” “The Bandits’ Club,” and “The Mafia” in furtherance of the conspiracy. The plaintiffs allege that each defendant (major banks such as Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citi) participated in chat rooms discussing multiple currencies. The plaintiffs allege that over time, various chat rooms, in furtherance of the conspiracy, evolved to discuss numerous currency pairs beyond those for which they were originally established. Ms. Hosler participated in numerous multibank chat rooms with FX traders from other defendant banks, including without limitation, Credit Suisse, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Standard Chartered, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and UBS. At least one of the individuals with whom Ms. Hosler participated in a chat room during the class period was an FX trader from non-settling defendant Credit Suisse. Ms. Hosler’s testimony is necessary to determine at trial the meaning of her communications and her knowledge of the conspiracy. Ms. Hosler’s testimony regarding her chat room communications is relevant to explain numerous multibank chats in which she participated because FX traders have their own unique jargon that is difficult to interpret. Ms. Hosler’s testimony also is necessary to explain communications through other media for which written evidence may not exist, such as text messages and phone calls. Ms. Hosler’s testimony regarding her knowledge of compliance issues is relevant for trial because Plaintiffs intend to prove either that Defendants lacked compliance measures to prevent the conspiracy and/or knew of violations of compliance policies and failed to prevent them. Ms. Hosler’s testimony regarding her own profit and loss in foreign exchange is relevant to show a motive to conspire and injury to the plaintiffs. Below are excerpts of the chats: Let’s note that, in her own Employment Tribunal action against her former employer, Ms. Hosler asserted that the breach of client confidentiality for which she had allegedly been fired was actually “the norm as expected, encouraged, condoned, and indeed rewarded by management.” She further stated, “I have always maintained that I only ever did my job as encouraged and condoned by management, who did not put any explicit rules in place regarding participation in market chats until 2013,” which was at the end of the class period. In her former supervisor’s Employment Tribunal claim, Ms. Hosler also provided a statement wherein she said, “we were actively encouraged and required to build and maintain close two-way relationships with traders at other banks in order to gain information about market flows and colour.” The examination of Ms. Hosler will not, in the opinion of the New York Southern District Court, be oppressive to Ms. Hosler in all the circumstances and bearing in mind the protections available to her. The U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office has closed its criminal investigations into allegations of fraudulent conduct in the FX market. While the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) may have ongoing investigations involving conduct in the FX market, Ms. Hosler is outside of the terms of the stay of depositions sought and received by the DOJ in the New York Southern District Court. Finally, Ms. Hosler’s deposition will proceed under the terms of the protective order and, therefore, will be given confidential treatment in connection with this litigation."

Early this morning, the broker confirmed that the display of the order book on MT4/MT5 was not functioning. The company said that this had to do with a project related to increasing security.

The issues did not affect the order book display via the broker’s website. Also this morning, however, customers could not contact OANDA Japan via phone. The phone enquiry service was down from 8am to 9am. The company apologized for the inconvenience caused to its customers. Last week, the broker warned that there will be a change of the server name for MT4 demo accounts. OANDA said it will change the name of the MT4 server its clients are currently using after the maintenance on Saturday, December 12th, from OANDA-v20 Practice-1 to OANDA-Demo-1. The broker promised that there would be no effect on one’s account and access from the MT4 desktop version, but if clients are trading from the mobile app, they may need to reselect the new demo server and log in again with their login information. OANDA apologized for the inconvenience, and thank traders for their understanding."

In theory, copy trading (also known as social trading or mirror trading) allows novice traders to mimic more experienced traders; allows the more experienced traders to make money by earning a percentage of the profits their “followers” earn; and the broker gets to attract both new and experienced traders attracted to the scheme, and enjoy higher trading volumes. In theory, a win-win-win proposition. However like with many things (especially those “things” to which retail trader money get attracted) in practice it doesn’t always go like in theory. Apparently about 1,200 young Australians, some in their teens, were recently caught up in a copy trading disaster when a trader “leader” they were following went rogue and wiped out their investments in 48 hours. According to the SMH, most of the followers who were wiped out had their accounts with Australian Retail FX broker IC Markets (which recently had an offshore affiliate banned in Italy, leading to the breakup of a planned €14 million sponsorship of Italian football squad Inter Milan by IC Markets). IC Markets, for its part, told the SMH that it does not even directly offer copy trading, saying instead the product was offered by third parties. Apparently the wiped-out traders were indeed using the copy functionality of a third party trading platform offered across many brokers, including IC Markets. ASIC has felt the heat lately to be tougher on the Retail FX and CFD market, and better protect retail traders, after a number of broker bankruptcies and scams have left retail traders holding the bag. ASIC and administrator-turned-liquidator BRI Ferrier have been busy for the past few months sorting through the bankruptcy of USGFX, a mid-sized FX broker that went bust in the summer. Nearly half a year after the firm folded the regulator and BRI Ferrier are still trying to figure out how many millions in client money are missing. That followed the bankruptcy of AGM Markets Pty Ltd, which operated the AlphaBinary brand. Soon after AlphaBinary (although already in administration) and its introducing brokers were issued a $75 million fine, in late October ASIC announced that, starting in March 2021, it was going to introduce new rules governing Retail FX and CFD brokerage, including maximum leverage of 30x on CFDs and negative balance protection for retail traders. No mention was made at the time of copy trading, but as noted above apparently that area is also now being reviewed by ASIC. The SMH quoted an unnamed spokesperson for ASIC who reportedly said: “We are engaging with firms on their practices and implications for clients. We note there has been increased levels of retail investor activity in securities this year and an increase in advertising of copy trading services.” Copy trading and offering social interaction between traders has been an area of focus for many Retail FX brokers worldwide over the past few months. eToro – also licensed in Australia – is probably the Retail FX broker which has been promoting copy trading the longest and the most. And it has worked -Israel based eToro just landed unofficial “unicorn” status, when shares of the broker changed hands at a reported $2.5 billion valuation. eToro, which on its homepage calls for calls for traders to “join the Social Trading revolution”, was also a focus of the SMH article which noted that the broker has been using popular Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin to promote its services in a series of video commercials. In the ad promoting copy trading (see below) Baldwin explains to a simple minded sock puppet just how easy it is to copy trade. Other brokers have been following eToro’s lead and pushing social and copy trading among their retail traders. Hamburg, Germany based NAGA Group AG, a social trading focused broker, has put up impressive growth numbers this year. Other brokers have turned to white-labeling copy trading software platforms from third party providers such as Pelican Trading. The eToro copy trading ad starring Alec Baldwin follows:"

FNG has learned that Retail FX and CFDs brokerage group FXCM has established a beachhead in Cyprus ahead of the end of Brexit’s transitional phase at year-end 2020. The company actually set up FXCM EU Ltd in the EU island nation in late 2019, and spent the better part of 2020 in an application process for a CIF license from Cypriot regulator CySEC. Even for established brokers such as FXCM (and FOREX.com, see more on that below), the CySEC licensing process is a thorough and lengthy one. FXCM formally received its CySEC CIF license on November 23 (license number 392/20). The company has also set up a number of EU client destination websites, namely fxcm.com/eu, fxcm.com/fr, fxcm.com/it, fxcm.com/gr, and fxcm.com/es. For now the Cyprus operation is being run by London based FXCM UK COO Juan Miguel Cafe. However we understand that the company plans some senior personnel additions as the entity starts full operation in earnest early next year. FXCM’s longtime US rival FOREX.com, now owned by StoneX, is also in process of applying for a CySEC license. In StoneX’s latest 10-K disclosure it stated that the CIF “license application is currently under consideration by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.” As of the beginning of 2021, UK licensed firms will no longer be able to passport their FCA license into EU member countries to serve clients in those countries (and vice versa), requiring FX brokers such as FXCM and FOREX.com to have licensed subsidiaries both in the UK to serve UK clients, and in at least one EU country from where that license can be passported to all other EU nations. Cyprus has been the EU country-of-choice for many if not most Retail FX firms, having a multitude of brokers already on the island with a robust infrastructure and personnel available to work in the Retail FX sector. FXCM is controlled by US investment bank Jefferies Financial. Other than Cyprus, the company has licensed subsidiaries in the UK, Australia, and South Africa."

GKFX revenues for 2019 came in at £3.63 million, down 59% from the previous year’s £8.86 million, as the company surrendered its FCA Retail permissions to focus entirely on Professional and Wholesale clients. The company’s net loss of £8.96 million was actually smaller than the £9.42 million loss posted in 2018. The company said that despite this change in clients, the principal activity of the group remains unchanged and therefore the directors are of the opinion that all activities are considered to be continuing. During the first half of the year the retail trade was transferred to AKFX Financial Services Ltd, based and regulated in Malta. AKFX is a related party to GKFX by virtue of common ownership. The GKFX group is controlled by Turkish businessman Kasim Garipoglu. The company’s MiFID Branches in Spain and Germany ceased offering regulated services in 2019, and its representative office in Dubai ceased regulatory activities. The company has also re-branded from GKFX to GKPro to better reflect its new target market. The GKFX brand, as noted above, is now operated by the Malta-based AKFX. Despite the continued losses GKFX reported that it remains well capitalized. As of 31st December 2019, the firm’s regulatory capital resources comprise issued capital less reserves and totaled £19,444,094 (2018 – £28,092,038). Iain Rogers The change in strategy also brought with it a change in management for GKFX. The company brought on board former Admiral Markets, Pepperstone UK, and GMI UK executive Iain Rogers as its Executive Director in mid 2019. Mr. Rogers replaced Rob Woolfe, who left GKFX to now head London Capital Group. GKFX’s 2019 income statement and balance sheet follow:"

The hearing for the conversion of Avenica’s bankruptcy from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7 has been postponed. The case, initially filed early in 2017, concerns the bankruptcy of Avenica Inc. The company used to provide services and technical support to FX broker Gallant Capital Markets, which also filed for Chapter 11 relief in April 2017. In fact, the estates of Gallant and Avenica were administered jointly by Esther DuVal, CPA, as their Chapter 11 Trustee. Let’s also note that Salvatore Buccatello held 100% of the membership interest in Avenica and was the CEO of both debtors. Now, Avenica’s case is set for a shift. On December 22, 2020, Esther DuVal filed a notice with the Court informing it that she will present a proposed Stipulated Order converting the Avenica, Inc. estate from a Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 case. The reason for that change is that the Avenica estate had no assets for the Trustee to administer, and thus could not fulfill the requirements under Bankruptcy Code § 1129. Chapter 11 is often called the reorganization chapter, as it allows businesses and some individuals to reorganize, without having to liquidate all assets. In filing a Chapter 11, the debtor presents a plan to creditors, which, if accepted by the creditors and approved by the Court, will allow the debtor to reorganize personal, financial or business affairs, and again become a financially productive entity. Chapter 7 is also known as the liquidation chapter. It is used by individuals and businesses that are unable to repair their financial situation. In Chapter 7, asset classes, the debtor’s estate is liquidated under the rules of the bankruptcy code. Liquidation is the process through which the debtor’s non-exempt property is sold for cash by a trustee and the proceeds are distributed to creditors. A letter filed by the firm representing Esther DuVal in her capacity as the Chapter 11 Trustee of the jointly administered estates of Avenica, Inc. and Gallant Capital Markets, Ltd. on January 19, 2021, stated that the conversion hearing is rescheduled. The letter confirms the adjournment of the Conversion Hearing from Tuesday, January 19, 2021 to February 25, 2021. Back in May 2017, when the motion for the joint administration of the estates of Avenica Inc and Gallant Capital Markets was filed, the debtors estimated that there were more than 1,200 customers and parties-in-interest in these bankruptcy cases."

(NASDAQ:SNEX) has announced that its London-based subsidiary, StoneX Financial Ltd has entered into a four-year partnership with Saracens, one of Europe’s most successful rugby clubs. Beginning this month, StoneX will become Saracens’ main club sponsor and its home ground in London will be named StoneX Stadium. City Index, the London-based subsidiary of Gain Capital which was acquired by StoneX in July 2020, will be featured as lead partner on both the men’s and women’s kits. Interestingly, no mention was made in the sponsorship of the other brand StoneX bought with Gain Capital – Retail FX brand FOREX.com. Saracens is one of the most renowned clubs in European rugby. The men’s team has won the European Champions Cup three times in the last five years and the Premiership five times in the last ten years. The women’s team has won the last two Premier XV titles. The sponsorship deal with Saracens looks to solidify StoneX’s and City Index’s position at the forefront of capital markets and online trading, by teaming up with one of the most decorated sporting clubs on the continent. The partnership also sees an alignment of core values and culture of winning from both brands, which place a great emphasis on discipline and an unwavering commitment to achievement. Philip Smith, CEO of StoneX Financial Ltd, commented on the news, “I’m delighted to announce a long-standing partnership with Saracens as both the club and StoneX have a relentless drive to achieve excellence. For both organisations, the phrase ‘pounding the rock’ is ubiquitous and is one that both our traders and Saracens players can relate to.  Hard work, patience and dedication to our clients is at the core of our value proposition as a global financial services organization. These values are shared by Saracens Rugby Club, and are exemplified by their high performance culture and commitment to player welfare as well as their fan base. I’m excited to see how the partnership develops over the coming months and years.” The parties said that the partnership is a significant vote of confidence in Saracens as professional rugby continues to face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will help to ensure that the club retains its elite management and players, while maintaining its world-leading academy. It will also help to support the proposed development of the stadium’s West Stand and the club’s significant commitment to bring about positive social change within the local community through the Saracens Foundation and the Saracens High School. Lucy Wray, Saracens CEO, said, “We are really excited to enter this new, long-term partnership with StoneX, one of the world’s leading financial groups. We share a commitment to excellence and innovation and we are looking forward to the start of a memorable journey with them. This is a major moment for the Saracens family. The partnership heralds a fresh start for the club after a hugely challenging year and having met some of the people at StoneX and City Index, I can safely say that they share our ambition and values.” StoneX Group Inc. is a global financial services network that connects its clients to nearly all major financial markets worldwide, and to the expertise, tools and intelligence they need to succeed in those markets. Through a unique combination of institutional-grade market access and high-touch service, StoneX provides access to 36 derivatives exchanges, 175 foreign exchange markets, nearly every global securities marketplace and a number of bi-lateral liquidity venues."

No reason was given for Per Hellberg’s abrupt departure. He had been with Catena since mid 2018, after serving as CEO of Swedish online magazines site Readly for five years. Catena has had a rough 2019. Catena Media shares traded down by 17% in late November after the company reported disappointing Q3 results. The company announced that Chairman Göran Blomberg has been appointed interim CEO. Mr. Blomberg has been a member of the board of Catena Media since 2019 and chairman since 2020. He will step down as chairman of the Board during his time as interim CEO. Öystein Engebretsen will serve as acting chairman during Mr. Blomberg’s tenure as CEO. Catena noted that a search process for a new permanent CEO will now be undertaken. Mr. Engebretsen released a brief statement, “We are pleased to appoint Göran Blomberg as the new interim CEO of Catena Media. Mr. Blomberg has solid experience and brings more than 30 years of managerial experience to the role in public listed environment. This makes him a good fit with Catena Media for the transition period. The board also want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Hellberg for his time with Catena Media.” Göran Blomberg has been a member of Catena’s board of directors since May 2019 and served as chairman since May 2020. Mr. Blomberg has more than 30 years of managerial experience, primarily as CFO of publicly listed companies, most recently at ICA handlarnas Förbund (ICA Retailers’ Association). Mr. Blomberg has also served on the board of directors of a large number of public and private corporations. Mr. Engebretsen has been a member of Caten’s board since October 2018. Mr. Engebretsen is Investment Manager at Investment AB Öresund and board member of INSR Insurance Group ASA and Scandi Standard AB. Catena Media scaled rapidly through an acquisitions-driven strategy between 2016 and 2018, and during that time branched out from owning and operating (primarily) gaming related sites into Forex related websites. However earlier this year the company announced that it was making “no further investments into the Financial Services segment”. The last two years the company has been going through a consolidation phase to integrate recently acquired assets. Concurrently with its asset consolidation, Catena Media said that it has successfully entered the US and Japanese markets and developed the highly profitable AskGamblers product within the European market. Göran Blomberg said: “Subsequently to strengthening the company’s financial position through a successfully executed rights issue of a hybrid bond in June we now will refocus on organic growth and potential strategic acquisitions. Additionally, we will improve operational efficiency through an enhanced focus on BI and AI to create an even more scalable business solution. McKinsey & Company has just been engaged to further accelerate this transformation process.” Mr. Engebretsen added: “To execute and lead Catena Media through this transformation process The Board has commenced the search for a new CEO with relevant professional experiences and a track record of success to facilitate Catena Media’s shift into an even more profitable growth phase.”"

At his first Court appearance back in August 2020, he posted a $250,000.00 appearance bond that has been deposited with the United States District Court. On Mr. Hughes’ behalf and with his consent, his counsel requested that his bond conditions be modified as follows: that the $250,000.00 appearance bond be reduced to $150,000.00 and that the remaining $100,000.00 be released back to him for the purpose of funding his legal costs and expenses. Today, the Court granted the motion. Let’s recall that, on August 18, 2020, the Department of Justice announced charges against a number of individuals behind AirBit Club. The list included Pablo Renato Rodriguez, Gutemberg Dos Santos, Scott Hughes, Cecilia Millan and Jackie Aguilar. The defendants participated in a coordinated scheme in which victim-investors were induced to invest in AirBit Club based on the promise of guaranteed profits in exchange for cash investments in club “memberships”. Promoters falsely promised the victims that AirBit Club earned returns on cryptocurrency mining and trading and that the victims would earn passive, guaranteed daily returns on any membership purchased. Rodriguez, Dos Santos, Hughes, Millan, and Aguilar traveled throughout the United States, and around the world to places in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, where they hosted lavish expos and small community presentations aimed at convincing investors to purchase AirBit Club memberships. Hughes, an attorney licensed to practice law in California, had previously represented Rodriguez and Dos Santos in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation related to another investment scheme known as Vizinova before aiding Rodriguez and Dos Santos in perpetrating the AirBit Club Scheme by, among other things, helping to remove negative information about AirBit Club and Vizinova from the internet. Hughes and the other defendants in this case sought to conceal the AirBit Club scheme, as well as their respective control of the proceeds of that scheme, by requesting that the victims purchase memberships in cash, using third-party cryptocurrency brokers, and by laundering the scheme’s proceeds through several domestic and foreign bank accounts, including an attorney trust account managed by Hughes. The Hughes Trust Account was ostensibly intended to maintain custody of Hughes’s law practice’s client funds. Instead, the Hughes Trust Account was used by Rodriguez, Dos Santos, Hughes, and Millan to conceal the nature and origin of the AirBit Club Scheme’s illicit proceeds. Through that account, Hughes directed the victim funds to the personal expenses of Rodriguez, Dos Santos, Millan, and himself, and funded promotional events and sponsorships designed to further promote the AirBit Club scheme. In total, the defendants laundered at least $20 million in proceeds of the scheme through these various methods."

The changes cover a range of terms in the company’s stock CFDs and equity ETFs offering, including type of instrument offered, portfolio size limits, leverage, and commissions. Admiral Markets has sent a note to clients (see full text below) indicating that it will not be offering any trading in small-cap stock CFDs. As of today, Admiral Markets will switch to close-only mode any client positions in share CFDs where the market price of the share traded is below a certain level (roughly USD $5 / €5 / £5). As of February 7, it will only offer trading in equity CFDs of companies that have a market cap of USD $1 billion or greater. Starting from next week (February 7), the maximum exposure limit applicable to a portfolio of stock CFDs and ETF CFDs will be €100,000 for each trading account. The company’s zero-fee trading offer in the segment of Stock CFDs and ETF CFDs will be discontinued as of February 15. Admiral Markets is also introducing more strict margin requirements on leveraged equity CFD positions, with different margin required for Retail and Professional traders. Jens Chrzanowski, Member of the Group Management Board at Admiral Markets Group AS told FNG about the changes: “We see some brokers even stopped the onboarding of new clients these days, to manage the risks they have. We are ready to welcome you on board at Admiral Markets, as fast as possible, including many free instant payment methods, for your quick start of trading with us. We are proud to say: We are the quality market leader, we just got in the young year of 2021 an award as “Best CFD Broker 2021” in our core market Germany by the DKI, Deutsches Kundeninstitut. To keep our high-quality standards, we had to move to low commissions for Stock and ETF CFDs now, which are still very competitive as compared to other CFD brokers.” The full note sent out by Admiral Markets on the matter follows: Changes in Stock CFDs and ETF CFDs trading terms February 04, 2021 Dear Traders, National governments across the globe are applying even more extraordinary measures to prevent an anticipated economic downturn. The unprecedented amount of monetary stimulus not only provides much-needed support to our local communities, but also sends shockwaves through the financial system which in turn create imbalances and volatility breakout stories for the history books. In response to the challenges that online securities brokerage firms are facing, we decided to do the following changes in the trading terms of our Stock CFDs and ETF CFDs on our Trade.MT4 and Trade.MT5 accounts: Leveraged trading in penny and low price stock CFDs We will switch certain CFD instruments into close-only trading mode: 4 February 2021 7 February 2021 All stock CFDs and ETF CFDs if current market price is less than: 5 USD / 5 EUR / 5 GBP / 5 CHF / 25 DKK / 50 NOK / 50 SEK / 5 AUD / 500 JPY All stock CFDs where underlying stock issuers market capitalization is less than 1 Billion USD (or equivalent in other currencies) Exposure limit per each trading account Starting from 7 February 2021 the maximum exposure limit applicable to a portfolio of stock CFDs and ETF CFDs will be 100,000 EUR per each trading account. If the value of your open positions in these instruments increases above the limit, you will not be able to add more Stock CFDs or ETF CFDs to your CFD account. You are not required to close any of your open positions (unless you wish to do so) if the value of your portfolio of open positions appreciates beyond this limit. Transaction fees for Stock CFD and ETF CFD Our zero-fee trading offer in the segment of Stock CFDs and ETF CFDs will be discontinued on 15 February 2021. Starting from this day and going forward, every transaction in these instruments will be subject to a transaction fee as outlined below. Fees will apply to both new and old positions, including those opened prior to 15 February. Market Transaction fee Minimum fee USA 0.02 USD per share 1 USD Germany 0.1 % of trade value 1 EUR France 0.1 % of trade value 1 EUR UK / GBP-denominated 0.1 % of trade value 1 GBP UK / USD-denominated 0.1 % of trade value 1 USD UK / EUR-denominated 0.1 % of trade value 1 EUR Other Europe / EUR-denominated 0.15 % of trade value 1 EUR Other Europe / USD-denominated 0.15 % of trade value 1 USD Other Europe / DKK-denominated 0.15 % of trade value   30 DKK Other Europe / NOK-denominated 0.15 % of trade value   10 NOK Other Europe / SEK-denominated 0.15 % of trade value 10 SEK Other Europe / CHF-denominated 0.15 % of trade value 1 CHF Australia 0.15 % of trade value 8 AUD Japan 0.15 % of trade value 1250 JPY With Stock and ETF CFDs, you have the great option to go long and short in the market and trade on margin with leverage. Even with these changes, our transaction fees for stock & ETF CFD are still very competitive, which often charge a minimum fee of 10 USD for US stock CFD, for example. Our minimum fee is 10 times lower. Leverage rate changes for CFDs on Stocks and ETFs Starting from 15 February 2021 new adjusted leverage rates will be assigned to each particular stock CFD and ETF CFD to reflect liquidity conditions of the underlying security and market capitalization of the underlying stock issuer or assets under management (“AuM”) for ETFs. The general principle is that less liquid stocks of smaller companies will be available with lower leverage. The maximum possible leverage will also depend on your client category. New higher or lower leverages will apply to all new positions in Stock CFDs and ETF CFDs. Previously established positions remain unaffected only until your next trading action in any of these instruments. When we execute a trading order of any type (including stop-loss orders, take profit orders, automated trade executions by a Robot/EA and partial closes), we will instantly apply new leverage to all your open positions in this instrument. Here is what to expect: Underlying security features New margin requirements Retail Clients Professional Clients Stocks: constituent of a major index: SP500, DJIA30, NQ100, DAX30, CAC40, STOXX50, FTSE100, IBEX35, AEX25, ASX200, Nikkei225, and issuer market cap above 50 Billion USD 20% (Leverage 5:1) 5% (Leverage 20:1)   Stocks: constituent of a major index: SP500, DJIA30, NQ100, DAX30, CAC40, STOXX50, FTSE100, IBEX35, AEX25, ASX200, Nikkei225, and issuer market cap between 5 – 50 Billion USD ETFs: ETF AuM above 50 Billion USD 20% (Leverage 5:1) 10% (Leverage 10:1) Stocks: price above 5 USD, and issuer market cap above 5 Billion; ETFs: price above 5 USD, and ETF AuM above 5 Billion USD 20% (Leverage 5:1) 20% (Leverage 5:1) All other stocks and ETFs not falling into any of groups above 50% (Leverage 2:1) 50% (Leverage 2:1) We are ready to help and ready to onboard you Challenging times bring about daily opportunities and risks. We see some brokers even stopped onboarding of new clients these days, to manage the risks they have.

We are proud to say: We are the quality market leader, we just got in the young year of 2021 an award as “Best CFD Broker 2021” in our core market Germany by the DKI, Deutsches Kundeninstitut. We are monitoring closely the developments in financial markets as they go through the unchartered territory of the economic development cycle. In high volatile times like now, still trading brings you huge chances – but also risks. It could be a good idea to focus on the high liquid instruments now, as DAX30, DJI30, Gold and EURUSD. These are the most traded instruments at Admiral Markets in 2020, and we give you the best trading condition here as always!

Revenues for Trading Point UK totaled £666,522 in 2019, down from £3.1 million the previous year. The company posted a loss of £1.3 million in 2019, versus a profit of £1.7 million in 2018. The decrease in the revenue figure is as a result of a decrease in the number of active clients to 4,718 in 2019 (2018: 15,074), and lower trading volumes from those clients. Trading Point of Financial Instruments UK Limited is the UK arm of Cyprus based and CySEC-licensed Trading Point of Financial Instruments Ltd. The company said that the year 2019 was a year of change for the company. The new restrictive measures on CFD trading which were imposed in August 2018 by ESMA and were permanently adopted by the FCA in August 2019 had a material impact on the industry. These regulatory measures were the principal reason for the company’s lower trading volumes during the year. In addition, in July 2019, the company rebranded its trading name in the UK from “XM.com” to “trading.com” which, together with a renewed marketing strategy, the company expects will help expand its client base. The group now operates the XM.com brand out of the Cyprus operation as well as offshore via XM Global Limited in Belize. (There are also licensed subsidiaries in Australia and Dubai). The trading.com brand, in addition to being used in the UK, is planned to be used for a US launch later this year, as was exclusively reported by FNG last month. The principal activities of the company comprise the provision of online trading delivered through the company’s trading platform. Trading Point UK enables retail customers to trade global over-the-counter CFDs (Contract for Difference) on currency pairs, equities, indices and commodities markets. The company acts as the counterparty to all trades entered into by its clients. The company receives commission income from its related group entity Trading Point of Financial instruments Ltd (in Cyprus) based on the total trading volume of all its clients’ trading activity. The company’s Net Asset position dropped to £3,748,034 as at year-end 2019 (2018: £5,076,545), and this was due to the losses incurred during the year. In addition, cash and cash equivalent also decreased to £3,657 465 (2018: £5,303,501). Management said it reviews the cash position of the company on a regular basis to ensure that it has the liquidity to operate without any external financial support.

The deal between the parties doesn’t seem to have much to do with Brexit, as LMAX also operates an EU (Cyprus) based licensed subsidiary. Conotoxia stated that the rationale for the agreement is that Poland clients will still be able to enjoy the execution of LMAX orders, and receive the benefits from attractive pricing conditions offered by Conotoxia. However given that Conotoxia pricing effectively flows from LMAX in the first place, we believe that the deal is mostly focused on Conotoxia simply being able to provide better local customer service, in Polish, to Poland based clients. LMAX Global offers brokers and professional traders around the world access to institutional FX liquidity, tight spreads and transparent, precise execution with no ‘last look’ rejections. The company operates regulated FX brokers in the UK (FCA), Europe (CySEC) and New Zealand (Registered Financial Service Provider). Conotoxia is based in and operated mainly from Warsaw and Zielona Góra in Poland, but is licensed in Cyprus via group subsidiary Conotoxia Ltd. The company operates websites conotoxia.com and cinkciarz.pl, focusing mainly on the Poland domestic market and clients in other Eastern European markets. The company is controlled by founder and CEO, Polish entrepreneur Marcin Pioro. Conotoxia is the third largest domestic Retail FX broker in Poland, after publicly traded XTB.com and TMS Brokers, which was recently acquired by OANDA."

Tallinn, Estonia based Admiral Markets AS said that it has received a notification by Finantsinspektsioon on 08.02.2021, imposing a fine of 32,000 euros deriving from obligations of the Securities Market Act. Admiral Markets AS said it is in constant cooperation with Finantsinspektsioon and has always acted in the best interests of the client. In April 2020, for the first time, an event took place in the global financial markets, as a result of which the international financial platforms were not ready to reflect negative prices and calculate credit limits. Sergei Bogatenkov, CEO of Admiral Markets AS, confirmed that the company acted in the best interests of its customers and ensured that customers could continue to trade in global financial markets. “We have always been committed to ensuring that the interests of our customers around the world are protected. In this situation, we stood up to reduce the potential impact on our customers. The goal of Admiral Markets is always to be a quality leader, to offer the best service and open communication with its customers and cooperation partners,” Bogatenkov noted. “We informed our customers early on of possible anomalies in the financial markets and asked them to be vigilant.” According to Admiral Markets AS, not all market-specific circumstances have been taken into account in making the decision, therefore the company will decide on contesting it in the near future. As a reminder, in April 2020 in the midst of general financial markets pandemonium in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, crude oil prices turned negative for the first time in history, as demand for crude dropped and short term storage for crude filled up. The turn negative by crude presented a problem for a number of trading platforms, which simply weren’t built for negative prices. Since that event, a number of trading platforms (such as MetaQuotes’ MT5) have made changes taking account of the possibility of negative prices."

Nicolas Breteau, Group CEO of TP ICAP, said: “Andrew’s proven capability to build industry-leading businesses positions him well to take our Global Broking franchise to the next level and continue to drive growth in E&C. He is forward-thinking when it comes to innovation and deploying technology, is entrepreneurial, pragmatic, and brings a dynamic, highly focused approach to execution. “As such, he is the ideal candidate to implement our electronification, aggregation and diversification strategy across our Markets activity globally, and, in so doing, extend our market leadership position.” Andrew Polydor said: “I am delighted to be taking up this role at such an important time for Global Broking and E&C. I am looking forward to working with my new colleagues to implement our progressive strategy and enhance how we serve our clients.” Andrew Polydor began his career in Financial Markets in 1982 before moving on to set up Prebon Energy Sydney in the late 1990s, which became the premier broker in the Australian power market. He also established Prebon Environmental Consultancy Services, a pioneer in the carbon markets. He later transferred to London to run Prebon’s growing energy business in Europe and was promoted to the position of Global Head of E&C at Tullett Prebon in 2008, becoming CEO of TP ICAP E&C in 2016."

The CFTC complaint, seen by FX News Group, was submitted on February 1, 2021, at the New York Southern District Court. The complaint alleges that on February 3, 2015, Gorman III, a U.S. dollar swaps trader and managing director of a global investment bank (the bank is unnamed in the complaint), trading from Tokyo, Japan for a U.S. affiliate of the Bank, engaged in a scheme to deceive and to manipulate the price of U.S. dollar interest rate swap spreads published on a screen displaying prices from a swap execution facility broker firm (SEF Broker Firm) in the United States. Gorman engaged in this scheme in order to benefit the Bank in a separate interest rate swap transaction with a bond issuer, the CFTC says. The Issuer entered into the interest rate swap transaction with a Japanese affiliate of the Bank in connection with a U.S. dollar-denominated bond issuance with a ten-year maturity. Both the Bond Issuance and Issuer Swap were priced on February 3, 2015, using a specific screen which displayed prices from the SEF Broker Firm (19901), including prices for U.S. dollar interest rate swap spreads with a ten-year maturity. Gorman allegedly knew that the Issuer Swap would be more profitable to the Bank if lower prices for Ten-Year Swap Spreads were displayed on the 19901 screen during the pricing of the Bond Issuance and Issuer Swap. Thus, Gorman engaged in a scheme to deceive and to manipulate the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads on a swap execution facility to maximize the Bank’s profit on the Issuer Swap, at the expense of the Issuer. Under the terms of the Issuer Swap, the Bank, through Gorman, would be “buying” a swap from the Issuer (that is, paying a fixed interest rate to the Issuer) based on terms set during the pricing call. As a result, Gorman could generate profit for the Bank by “selling” swaps (that is, receiving a fixed interest rate) for more than the price the Bank was “buying” them from the Issuer. Another way Gorman could increase profits for the Bank on the Issuer Swap was to “buy” the Issuer Swap at a lower price—which the Bank could do if a lower price for Ten-Year Swap Spreads was displayed on the 19901 screen during the pricing. On February 3, 2015 Gorman arranged to trade through a broker who worked at the SEF Broker Firm’s U.S. office. As he explained to another trader at the Bank in a text message on his personal cell phone, Gorman traded through the Broker because at the time the Issuer Swap was pricing, the prices displayed on the 19901 screen were controlled by the SEF Broker Firm in the United States and Gorman wanted to trade through a broker who could “move the screen the quickest.” Before and during the pricing of the Bond Issuance and Issuer Swap, Gorman knew that there was more buying than selling interest in Ten-Year Swap Spreads and knew that as a result, market prices for Ten-Year Swap Spreads had risen and were positioned to continue to rise. Due to the rising prices, Gorman’s supervisor, the head of the Bank’s U.S. Dollar swaps desk, advised Gorman to sell fewer Ten-Year Swap Spreads at the time of the pricing, because he thought they could sell more Ten-Year Swap Spreads at increasing profits after the time of pricing. Gorman timed his trading through the Broker during the pricing to move the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads down on the 19901 screen, in the opposite direction of where the market was moving. When Gorman stopped trading to move the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads down on the 19901 screen, the price on the screen immediately rose and, for over 18 hours, did not return to the level to which Gorman’s trading had moved it for the pricing. Gorman did not disclose to the Issuer that there were more bidders than sellers at the SEF Broker Firm, that market prices had been rising as a result of the heavy buying interest, or that the only reason a lower price was displayed on 19901 during the pricing call was because Gorman had sold Ten-Year Swap Spreads in order to move the price down. Gorman also did not disclose to the Issuer that he sold Ten-Year Swap Spreads during the pricing not because he legitimately wanted to sell at that price level at that time, but so the Bank could “buy” the Issuer Swap at a lower price, or that he was trading through the Broker in the United States because the 19901 screen was being controlled in the United States and thus his trading through the Broker would move the screen “the quickest.” Gorman’s trading had the effect of moving the price of the Ten-Year Swap Spread down on the 19901 screen, and the manipulated price was used to price the Issuer Swap with the Issuer, resulting in a more profitable transaction for the Bank and a less profitable transaction for the Issuer. Gorman later tried to cover up his misconduct. During the course of the Commission’s investigation of Gorman’s manipulative trading, the Commission’s Division of Enforcement sent Gorman a preservation request, asking that he preserve certain categories of communications on his personal cell phone. After receiving the request, Gorman deleted communications that were covered by the request, including communications on the messaging application WhatsApp. The CFTC accuses Gorman of violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulations. The Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, pre- and post-judgment interest."

Cyprus is known for its fast licensing mechanism as well as its business attitude. It also provides access to groups of young EU talent, with a high level of education, multilingual and mainly specialised in the field of technology.

At Plum, we have put technology at the heart of our services, with easy investments, instant alerts, improved analytics and automated savings. Thus, by investing in Cyprus, we are now actively contributing to the formation of the country’s FinTech scene.” Plum is a London and Athens based fintech startup.

DS TECHEETAH will invest the money in some of eToro’s top investors, using eToro’s innovative CopyTrader feature. The team will also invest in themes that align with the team’s values by investing in two of eToro’s thematic portfolios: Renewable Energy and Driverless. The latter portfolio contains a number of stocks in the electric car sector, including Stellantis – the owner of DS Automobiles, the manufacturer of DS TECHEETAH. eToro believes that this is the first time in the history of sport sponsorship that a deal has been structured in a way where a team risks its profits on the stock market, as the amount of money collected will depend on CopyTrader Investor profits. Traditional sponsorship models are based on a set fee, whereas in this case, it is fluid. Dylan Holman, Global Sponsorship Manager of eToro, said: ‘We are excited to work with DS TECHEETAH, who believe in our product as much as we do. We hope that by structuring our partnership in this unique way, we can raise awareness to more people around the world of the potential to grow their wealth through investing. We hope to work with more companies in a similar way in the future. “2020 saw a meteoric rise in retail participation in capital markets and we think this trend is here to stay. People want simple access to markets. eToro is a social investing platform where people can execute trades, but also see what others are doing and talk to each other. We were the first to bring social investing to the masses and took this concept one step further by inventing CopyTrader.” CopyTrader allows users to automatically copy the same trades as top investors in proportion to the amount users choose to invest. To copy an investor on eToro there is no cost and trades are carried out at exactly the same time and at the same market rate. CopyPortfolios offer people access to thematic investing. Keith Smout, Chief Commercial Officer of DS TECHEETAH, said: “We always want to be at the forefront of innovation, which is one of the key values of Formula E and DS TECHEETAH. There is a lot of synergy with this deal as a number of the DS TECHEETAH team, including two-time Formula E Champion Jean-Eric Vergne, have been using eToro’s CopyTrader. We have seen the benefits of investing in the financial markets and we’re excited about this partnership, as we aim to help demystify investing to our fans throughout the season.” This partnership sees eToro gain global exposure through an extensive range of marketing opportunities including featuring on the livery of the DS E-TENSE FE20, the team environment, digital rights, VIP tickets and more."

The report stated that AvaTrade is looking at a listing in London, that could value the company at up to £700 million (USD $960 million). The investment bankers mentioned as having been hired in the report are JP Morgan and Jefferies. Interestingly, Jefferies controls AvaTrade rival FXCM. Quoting “City sources,” the Sky News report said that the IPO was likely to launch in the coming months, depending upon market conditions and investor appetite. AvaTrade has a reported client base of more than 300,000 traders, spread across 150 countries. The company is run day-to-day from Dublin by CEO Daire Ferguson, a former treasury executive at pharmaceuticals company Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, and also has licensed subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa, Japan, the UAE, and Israel. AvaTrade is controlled by its two founding shareholders Emanuel Kronitz and Negev Nosatski. In mid 2015 AvaTrade’s shareholders agreed to sell the company to Playtech for $105 million. That deal fell apart when the Central Bank of Ireland did not approve the change of control in AvaTrade to a buyer which was also involved in the gaming industry. A similar deal Playtech struck to buy Plus500 for $700 million at around the same time was similarly scuttled by regulators. FNG contacted company management regarding the report, but did not receive a response. We’d also note that this is the second going-public piece of news regarding a Retail FX broker in as many weeks. After an initial exclusive report from FNG, last week eToro confirmed that it agreed to go public via a merger with an existing SPAC, at a valuation of over $10 billion. The announcements should not come as a surprise, given the general strength in equity markets and the fact that shares of publicly traded Retail FX brokers did very well in 2020 and into early 2021."

After gathering feedback from traders and the industry ASIC announced new regulations which are set to go live on March 29, 2021. Electronic trading major IG Group has posted a roadmap for the changes that will affect its Australian retail clients trading CFDs. The changes on IG accounts will be noticed from the week commencing Monday – March 22, 2021. Some of the changes include leverage ratio limits, standardized margin close out procedures, and negative balance protections for retail clients. The reason for such changes are to enhance protections for retail clients trading leveraged financial products in a rapidly growing market. The changes outlined below will apply to retail CFD accounts held with IG’s Australian office, this includes New Zealand accounts. Pro clients will not be impacted. Below is the full roadmap (unedited): Wednesday 24th March Collateral – Clients were able to link their CFD and share trading accounts to use funds and shares held in their share trading account to cover margin for their CFD positions. As of Wednesday 24th March linked collateral accounts will no longer be an option for retail clients. Once we delink collateral accounts as part of the regulatory changes, clients will no longer be able to rely on their share trading account to cover CFD margin and need to ensure enough funds are held directly in their CFD account to cover the required margin deposit. If you have insufficient funds at this time your leveraged trading account will be at risk of position closures. Thursday 25th March Select accounts set to closing only – Some clients may be trading with us under a select account, which allowed tailored rules around margin and liquidation. These account types will be switched to ‘closing only’ (i.e. the account type and agreed terms will remain, but you can only close your positions at your convenience and no new positions can be opened under this account type). Any new position would need to be opened under a newly set up, regular IG retail account, which will be accessible under the same login details. Saturday 27th March 2021 Margin Changes – Margin requirements to open and maintain leveraged positions was one of the more prominent aspects of the ASIC regulations. On the Saturday, 27th March new margin floors will be implemented across all ASIC retail accounts for all new positions. Pro Level 1 accounts will also have new margin floors applied to their accounts. Existing positions will keep current margin rates. You can find more information regarding retail margin requirements here and Pro margin requirements here. Retail clients will no longer be able to reduce their margin requirement by using stops. Negative balance protection – All retail clients contracting to our ASIC regulated entity will have negative balance protection applied to their account. Pro Level 1 accounts that have not activated collateral will also benefit from negative balance protection. Please note this will only apply to debts incurred on positions opened after 27 March 2021. Offsetting long and short positions – If a client is currently long and short a particular market then they will currently pay 10% of either leg. From 27th March, clients will have to pay 100% of the ASIC margin on each position. This change will only apply on new positions, therefore if you are currently long and short the same market then you will continue to receive the concession. Rollovers – When Retail or Pro Level 1 clients futures contracts rollover and a position is opened after the 27th March, then the new position will be margined basis the ASIC or Pro Level 1 minimums. Automatic Close Out – Although margin will not increase for existing positions opened before this date, all accounts will be subject to the standardised 50% closeout rule. If your account equity falls below 50% of the total margin deposit required then we will need to close positions on your account as soon as market conditions allow. IG has already had a 50% liquidation rule in place for standard accounts, however limited risk accounts and anyone using guaranteed stops will need to ensure they obtain enough funds on their account to cover margin in addition to all running loss on their positions. We will no longer be closing positions if your account is on margin call for 24 hours or leading in to the weekend. We will also ensure to waive any negative balance incurred on retail clients CFD trading accounts. Monday 29th March 2021 Rebates – Some retail clients may have received rebates based on trade volumes. ASIC regulations mean that retail clients will no longer receive any form of rebate. Any rebate accrued before the 29th March will still be credited. Refer-a-Friend – Bonuses for the refer-a-Friend scheme can only be paid on qualifying trades placed before 29th March. Share trading subscription fee – Clients that have held shares in their share trading account were able to have the quarterly subscription fee waived if they placed at least 3 trades in their linked CFD account. After this day, we will no longer be able to count CFD trades for the waiver of the quarterly subscription fee applied to share trading accounts. Any client that holds shares on a share trading account at the end of each quarter and has not traded at least 3 times across their share trading accounts only, will be charged the quarterly subscription fee. Traders may find additional information here."

OANDA has 30 days to respond to the NFA’s complaint. Assuming that the complaint then reaches a formal proceeding, OANDA faces possible expulsion or suspension for a specified period from NFA membership, plus a monetary fine not to exceed $500,000 for each violation found. The complaint contains five such violations. OANDA is the second largest Retail FX broker in the US, holding about $195 million of client funds. The NFA complaint notes the following. In May 2018, OANDA was acquired by a subsidiary of a private equity firm (CVC Capital Partners). The acquisition closed in October 2018. Starting at about the time of the acquisition, NFA said it noted an increase in the number and degree of deficiencies occurring at the firm. As alleged in more detail below, NFA identified these areas of deficiency to OANDA on separate occasions in 2018 and 2019 and instructed the firm to correct the deficiencies. At the same time, NFA also notified OANDA of the seriousness of these deficiencies and that continued deficiencies could subject the firm to disciplinary action. When NFA examined OANDA again in 2020, the firm had repeat deficiencies in several of the areas that NFA had identified previously to the firm. COUNT 1 During NFA’s 2020 exam of OANDA, NFA learned that a US-based OANDA customer had contacted the firm and complained that his account was hacked. The customer informed OANDA that, without his authorization, $5,000 had been transferred out of his account and into a UK bank account he did not recognize. Prior to that unauthorized transfer, an unknown individual had added a UK bank account to the U.S. customer’s profile with OANDA. The addition of a new, out-of-country account to a customer’s profile was suspicious activity covered under the red flags set out in OANDA’s AML procedures. Additionally, the request to transfer funds to an account that differed from the one the customer had used to deposit funds into his OANDA account was also suspicious activity covered under the red flags set out in OANDA’s AML procedures. OANDA’s AML procedures required staff who observed red flags with respect to an account to report the suspicious activity to the firm’s AML Compliance Officer immediately. However, OANDA staff failed to abide by the firm’s AML procedures and failed to notify OANDA’s AML Compliance Officer immediately of the suspicious activity set out above. After the customer complained to the firm, OANDA then filed a SAR and issued a $5,000 credit to the customer. OANDA’s failure to abide by its AML procedures was a repeat deficiency from NFA’s 2018 exam. Specifically, the 2018 exam revealed that OANDA failed to follow its AML policies and procedures. For example, the firm failed to flag any accounts that initiated three or more deposits per week, contrary to the firm’s AML policy. In those instances where OANDA flagged an account, the firm’s review of the accounts was insufficient given that the activity was sometimes not reviewed for a month or more after the suspicious activity had occurred. OANDA also opened customer accounts that were considered high risk based on the parameters set forth in its AML procedures and did not have any method to track or supervise these accounts. Although OANDA undertook corrective action after the 2018 exam, such corrective action was insufficient, as NFA’s 2020 exam revealed the firm was still failing to follow its AML procedures. By reason of the foregoing acts and omissions, OANDA is charged with violating NFA Compliance Rule 2-9(c). COUNT 2 NFA’s 2020 exam revealed the ISSP, dated April 2019, that OANDA used was patently insufficient. 27. For example, the ISSP did not include numerous required sections, including training, risk assessment, incident response, and access controls. Beyond the deficiencies apparent in the ISSP, OANDA also failed to provide all required employees with training on the ISSP. Specifically, in the period tested, OANDA had failed to train at least 20 employees who should have received ISSP training. Additionally, OANDA failed to implement safeguards for risks it had identified, contrary to its ISSP and NFA requirements. Finally, as alleged above in Count 1, an OANDA customer informed the firm that $5,000 had been stolen from his OANDA account in a hack. Yet OANDA failed to file the required notice with NFA regarding this cybersecurity incident that involved its commodity interest business and resulted in a loss of customer funds. OANDA’s failure to adopt and implement an adequate ISSP, including its failure to abide by the training requirement, is a repeat violation from NFA’s 2018 exam. Specifically, the 2018 exam found that OANDA’s ISSP lacked numerous required elements, although many of these were different than the required elements missing from the April 2019 ISSP. Additionally, the 2018 exam revealed that OANDA had failed to provide required training to employees on its ISSP. Although OANDA undertook corrective action after the 2018 exam to address these deficiencies, such corrective action was insufficient, as NFA’s 2020 exam revealed the firm was still maintaining an inadequate ISSP and still failing to train employees as required. By reason of the foregoing acts and omissions, OANDA is charged with violating NFA Compliance Rule 2-36(e). COUNT 3 OANDA has established procedures for the handling and resolution of customer complaints, as required by the Interpretive Notice to NFA Compliance Rule 2-36(e), entitled “Forex Transactions.” OANDA’s customer complaint procedures require the firm’s customer service personnel to flag customer communications as complaints when certain criteria are met. Communications that have been flagged as complaints are then reviewed by OANDA’s compliance department on a weekly basis. OANDA’s customer complaint procedures also require information about the complaint to be documented, including a description of the complaint resolution. Yet contrary to OANDA’s written customer complaint procedures, NFA’s 2020 exam revealed that the firm’s customer service personnel frequently failed to flag customer communications as complaints, even though the communications met the complaint criteria outlined in OANDA’s procedures. Because these complaints were never flagged at the customer service level, they were never escalated to compliance personnel for review as set out in the customer complaint procedures. Additionally, the 2020 exam revealed that OANDA repeatedly failed to adequately document customer complaints and their resolution, contrary to OANDA’s customer complaint procedures. The 2018 exam of OANDA had also revealed that the firm repeatedly failed to properly flag and document customer complaints and their resolution. Although OANDA undertook corrective action regarding the handling of customer complaints after both the 2018 and 2020 exams, this corrective action was insufficient. OANDA continues to fail to flag customer communications as complaints when required, hindering compliance review of those complaints. For example, on at least three occasions after the 2020 exam concluded, OANDA customers complained to the firm, but the firm failed to properly flag these complaints. By reason of the foregoing acts and omissions, OANDA is charged with further violating NFA Compliance Rule 2-36(e). COUNT 4 Over an approximately one-month period in January and February 2020, OANDA submitted six daily forex reports to NFA that contained inaccurate unrealized profit/loss (UPL) figures. Each of the six reports set forth UPL figures that had been copied exactly from the previous day’s daily forex report. OANDA corrected the reports after the filing deadline had passed. OANDA’s failure to make accurate filings under NFA Financial Requirements Section 13 is a repeat deficiency. For example, in 2019, OANDA made a total of 12 inaccurate daily forex reports—including reports with inaccurate UPL figures. OANDA self-corrected some of these inaccuracies before the filing deadline had passed, but others were only corrected when NFA prompted OANDA do to so. NFA’s 2018 exam also found OANDA reported inaccurate information in its monthly forex reports. In that case, the firm had migrated to a new back office system but failed to include all accounts, which resulted in inaccurate figures being reported throughout the reports. To remediate, OANDA had to refile its January 2018 through September 2018 monthly reports. In addition to its inaccurate filings under Financial Requirements Section 13, OANDA also previously failed to make timely filings under other NFA Financial Requirements. For example, despite being undercapitalized for a four-month period starting in April 2019, the firm did not file notice of its capital shortfall with NFA until August 21, 2019. Additionally, OANDA delayed filing notice with NFA until September 5, 2019 that the firm violated its equity withdrawal restriction level by making dividend payments in April and May 2019. NFA sent OANDA a warning letter on September 30, 2019 regarding the 2019 inaccurate filings under Financial Requirements Section 13 and late filings under other Financial Requirements, among other issues. In response, OANDA represented it was taking corrective action, including hiring additional staff and purchasing computing resources. However, this corrective action was insufficient, as OANDA continued to make inaccurate daily forex filings in 2020, as alleged in paragraph 48 above. By reason of the foregoing acts and omissions, OANDA is charged with violating NFA Financial Requirements Section 13. COUNT 5 As alleged above, OANDA failed to meet its obligation to diligently supervise its forex business and its employees. Over the last two years, NFA identified the areas of deficiency to OANDA and instructed the firm to correct the deficiencies. Concurrently, NFA informed the firm of the seriousness of the deficiencies and that continued deficiencies could subject the firm to disciplinary action. Nevertheless, NFA found that OANDA continued to fail to abide by its AML procedures; to adopt and enforce an adequate ISSP, including providing required training on the ISSP; to implement its written supervisory system for handling and resolving customer complaints; and to make accurate daily forex filings to NFA. As with every other deficiency alleged in this Complaint, OANDA’s failure to supervise is itself a repeat deficiency. NFA advised OANDA in a letter dated March 4, 2019 that the firm was failing to adequately supervise its activities. NFA again advised OANDA in a letter dated September 30, 2019 that the firm’s repeated deficiencies raised concerns about its commitment to ensuring compliance at all times with its regulatory obligations. Yet, despite these repeated admonitions, OANDA has failed to diligently supervise its employees and forex activities to ensure compliance with NFA requirements. By reason of the foregoing acts and omissions, OANDA is charged with violating NFA Compliance Rule 2-36(e). CONCLUSION As we note above, as per NFA rules NFA must file a written answer to the Complaint with NFA within thirty days of the date of the Complaint. Failure to file an answer shall be deemed an admission of the facts and legal conclusions contained in the Complaint. Failure to respond to any allegation shall be deemed an admission of that allegation. Failure to file an Answer as provided above shall be deemed a waiver of hearing. POTENTIAL PENALTIES, DISQUALIFICATION AND INELIGIBILITY At the conclusion of the proceedings conducted in connection with the issuance of this Complaint, NFA may impose one or more of the following penalties: (a) expulsion or suspension for a specified period from NFA membership; (b) bar or suspension for a specified period from association with an NFA Member; (c) censure or reprimand; (d) a monetary fine not to exceed $500,000 for each violation found; and (e) order to cease and desist or any other fitting penalty or remedial action not inconsistent with these penalties."

Make sure it is not you!,4/28/2021,"The following is a guest editorial courtesy of Andrew Saks, Head of Research and Analysis at ETX Capital. £7 billion. Let’s stop for a few minutes and think about that figure. £7 billion. The dismissive way in which this quite astonishing cumulative loss has been nonchalantly trotted out this morning as if it was of minor importance represents either a deliberate playing down of a self-inflicted catastrophe by some Tier 1 FX interbank dealers, or an absence of understanding the magnitude of the effect the risk management faux pas has had. Way down in this week’s news lie very scant reports on the actual losses made by the banks which were involved in the ill-fated Archegos hedge fund, in a format which simply lists them as financial metrics. There is, of course, far more to it than just figures on a balance sheet. First of all, for Tier 1 FX interbank dealers with massive market dominance to make a combined £7 billion loss as a result of the demise of just one hedge fund is enough to make one’s teeth itch. Secondly, how this occurred, when the firms now considering their losses are longstanding dominant forces in terms of FX market share who are constantly curtailing the extension of counterparty credit to very good quality OTC derivatives participants, should be a moot point. Japanese investment bank Nomura which is one of the world’s largest Tier 1 FX interbank dealers which serves its own domestic market which is the largest retail FX market in the world with over 35% of retail FX order flow taking place within Japan’s borders via domestic market FX brokerages which often individually conduct over $1 trillion in notional volume each month, revealed a £2.1billion hit yesterday and suspended its head of prime brokerage, Dougal Brech. UBS, one of the top ten in terms of interbank FX trading volume globally, also unveiled a £619million Archegos-related loss. Credit Suisse has already admitted a £3.9billion hit, while Morgan Stanley lost £655million. Credit Suisse, which had once been among the top 5 interbank FX dealers worldwide until five years ago when it had plummeted to fourteenth position and made an operating loss of $2 billion, was on track for a profitable year until the Archegos hedge fund went to the wall, exposing the bank to a massive black hole. Credit Suisse had demonstrated extremely good commercial conduct with regard to its interbank eFX business during  loss making years in the middle of last decade, however other aspects of its corporate structure have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and censuring which has cost the bank a fortune. The settlement with US Department of Justice which totaled £4.3 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the financial crisis had been a case in point to which CEO Tidjane Thiam began to concentrate even further on cost cutting. Japanese lenders MUFG and Mizuho are expected to report that Archegos cost them around £280 million in the first three months of this year. Archegos defaulted on its margin loans when some highly concentrated bets went against the “family office”, leaving a number of investment banks holding the bag. Before the full extent of the losses across the banking sector had been calculated, it was assumed that Credit Suisse and Nomura were the most affected. Two weeks ago, I stated publicly that now is the time to use the Archegos hedge fund incident as an example of how inept risk management from Tier 1 institutions can lead to problems of which certain areas of the FX industry which are completely unassociated with the banks that created the problem could have to bear the brunt. Subsequently, it is very important that traders in all areas of OTC derivatives including retail FX take a close look at how their brokerage conducts risk management, and whom their counterparty is. It may well be good practice to look closely at quality companies in regions of the world that have strong regulatory frameworks and high levels of customer security should something go awry. British FX and CFD brokers stand out in this respect, given that they own their own infrastructure, have their own in-house trading platforms meaning that they have invested significantly in providing the most structured and well developed trading experience for their clients rather than simply onboarding them as ‘leads’ and then placing them on an affiliate marketing-orientated third party platform over which the broker has no control. Being a valued client of a company which has its own trading infrastructure immediately places traders in a much more empowered position. Companies that have their own trading platform are invested in their clients’ trading activities and will generally engage a good quality domestic market client base over a long period of time and serve them properly, rather than consider them expendable and have no ability to provide a good quality product range as is the case with brokers that use a generic off-the-shelf platform. Additionally, clients of British brokers are automatically covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which backs customer funds up to £85,000 should a firm become insolvent. That is the highest level of protection in the world by far. Why is this relevant? Well, given the absent risk management by the banks which now stare down a collective hole of £7 billion whilst reporters and banking regulators look on haplessly, it is of paramount importance to ensure that traders do not put blind faith in these institutions which are clearly easily taken in by the ability to onboard a large fund regardless of risk, and yet curtail counterparty credit to the far more distributed and less risky FX market. Operating a good quality in-house risk book is of imperative importance as one of the key considerations for traders. Perhaps the questions that should be asked of brokers should be if the firm operates its own trading infrastructure, and if it operates a benevolent B-book, meaning that the company internalizes trades rather than sends them to a Tier 1 bank as counterparty whilst using genuine price feeds from a prime brokerage to ensure trades are executed at the correct market prices. By providing correct market pricing and executing trades in house, customers are protected from situations such as this. Brokers need to look toward diversifying their asset class base, being more masters of their own destiny by investing in the development of their own multi-asset platforms and being less reliant on Tier 1 bank counterparty credit. The same banks that demand over $50 million balance sheet proof before extending an OTC prime brokerage account to an OTC counterparty don’t use the same caution when they onboard hedge funds that can decimate them. Credit Suisse, Nomura et al may well have their own capital position decimated by this rashness. By operating a shrewd in-house risk management strategy, having a competent proprietary platform and offering a multi-asset environment where traders can execute across venues in all parts of the capital markets economy is the way forward.

Rivoire, who is accused of manipulation and fraud in connection with swaps related to a bond issuance, asks Japanese judicial authorities to help him in securing evidence from a Japanese company involved in the pricing call that is at the heart of the case brought against him. On December 19, 2019, the CFTC filed a complaint in New York Southern District Court alleging that the defendant, Christophe Rivoire, violated various United States federal statutes, including the Commodities Exchange Act. The Complaint involves one transaction involving subsidiaries of HSBC Holdings plc, a British multinational investment bank and financial services company, and the Issuer. In July 2012, HSBC served as co-underwriter and sole swap arranger on a $2 billion bond issuance and corresponding U.S. dollar interest rate swap for the Issuer. Under the terms of the Bond Issuance, the Issuer issued $2 billion 5-year obligation bonds and paid a fixed rate of interest to investors. The Bond Issuance was priced on a conference call on July 11, 2012. Concurrently with the Bond Issuance, the Issuer simultaneously entered into an Interest Rate Swap with HSBC, where the Issuer swapped its fixed-rate payment obligations for a floating rate obligation. The Issuer entered into the Interest Rate Swap in order to manage the interest-rate risk associated with the Bond Issuance. HSBC was the Issuer’s counterparty in the Interest Rate Swap, which was priced after the Bond Issuance on the same July 11, 2012 Pricing Call. Noriyuki Ishikawa and Tetsuya Oura both participated in the Pricing Call. The CFTC alleges that Rivoire, the head of HSBC’s North American Rates business, engaged in a scheme to manipulate the prices of U.S. dollar interest rate basis swaps with a five-year maturity, which were used to price the Interest Rate Swap. The CFTC alleges that manipulated prices were used to price the Interest Rate Swap, resulting in a more profitable transaction for HSBC and a less profitable transaction for the Issuer. Critically, the only specific victim that the CFTC identifies is the Issuer. The Issuer’s perspective is crucial because the Issuer is the only identifiable victim of the purported manipulation scheme, and the CFTC has requested this Court grant full restitution to the Issuer in the amount that the Issuer was harmed. But only the Issuer can speak to whether the Issuer experienced harm. Thus, the evidence requested will assist the Court in evaluating whether such a harm exists and resolving the disputed issues presented in this civil action, including whether the Issuer is entitled to restitution, as requested by the CFTC. Rivoire also seeks the testimony of Noriyuki Ishikawa, who is believed to be a current employee of the Issuer and, in July 2012, was the Deputy Director of the Capital Markets and Funding Division of the Issuer. Rivoire also requests that Tetsuya Oura, who, in July 2012, was the Director of the Capital Markets and Funding Division of the Issuer, to be summoned and examined. Mr Oura’s perspective is seen essential to this litigation. He can speak to the Issuer’s perspective on selecting the pricing procedures for the Bond Issuance and Interest Rate Swap, which led to problems during the Pricing Call. Additionally, since he participated in the Pricing Call, he can share his view as to whether the Pricing Call was resolved in a satisfactory manner to the Issuer. Lastly, based on his role and experience on the Transaction, Mr. Oura can also speak to the critical question in this litigation of whether the Issuer experienced any harm. The CFTC is also seeking international judicial assistance in this case."

The company noted that the gold standard to move money in and out of brokerage accounts (in the United States) has been “ACH,” the Automatic Clearing House. It’s the same type of transfer that’s most commonly used to transfer money between bank accounts. ACH was invented in the 1960s. It’s reliable but can also be slow and doesn’t necessarily deliver equal access. Why? Because not all banks are created equal. Most banks don’t have a modern API that makes it easy for fintech services to connect your bank account or transfer funds. This inequality in technical infrastructure is actually creating inequality in access to financial services and in turn access to the stock market. Public.com said that it is extremely excited to announce that starting today, it is making it possible to fund your Public account using your debit card. The company stated it believes debit cards even the playing field, as every card works equally well, no matter how technically advanced the underlying bank is. Debit card funding offers Public members more choice in how they add money, making investing more inclusive, and ensures that people with banks that are less technologically advanced have the ability to participate in the stock market. It also enables faster access: When you deposit money from your debit card, you receive instant access to those funds in Public. This is a massive improvement in speed compared to ACH deposits, which often have a 3–5 day settlement period. Soon, members who have their card on file will also have the unique experience of being able to fund and buy a stock seemingly instantaneously. For now, deposits from debit cards are limited to $1,000. Members have the option to use their debit card as an additional funding source or in place of linking their bank account to Public. Public.com said that offering the ability to fund your account with a debit card is just the beginning of its  journey to build a brokerage app that can run entirely on “debit card rails” — an important step on its stated mission to make the stock market more accessible and approachable for everyone. Founded just two years ago and co-run by well-known FX industry executive Jannick Malling (ex Saxo Bank, CFH Group, Tradable) and serial web entrepreneur Leif Abraham, Public.com is an app-only online broker, targeting younger traders with a social-trading bent. Its roster of investors and backers includes celebrities such as actor/rapper Will Smith, NFL star JJ Watt, popular Youtuber Casey Neistat, and skateboarder Tony Hawk."

ETX Capital is one of the UK’s leading online CFD and spread betting companies, and as such, their target market has predominantly been the UK until now.

Their sights are apparently set on Europe and cementing the ETX brand throughout the region. The company said that it is an exciting time for the firm, with hiring ramped up, and big plans on the horizon across the entire business. ETX Capital CEO Philip Adler had this to say on the company’s plans for Europe, “I am delighted that Guru Capital is now the owner of our Cypriot sister company. ETX has a long tradition of offering best in class service to our UK clients and we are looking forward to ETX Cyprus picking up that baton and being at the heart of ETX’s European expansion.” Ryan Nettles, Managing Partner at Guru Capital, commented, “The ETX platform offers a very compelling opportunity for European traders due to its user-friendly functionality and multi-asset offering with over 5,000 tradeable instruments.” ETX Cyprus will be the European HQ for the group, with the company only weeks away from onboarding European clients through the new entity."

The lawsuit against the scammers, however, does not seem to be making any material progress, and is in fact set for further delays. According to a motion filed by the CFTC with the Texas Western District Court on April 15, 2021, the case will be protracted, because the regulator has not yet effected service of the complaint on most of the defendants. Let’s recall that the action names 10 defendants – six individuals and four companies. They are charged with operating a fraudulent binary options trading scheme that received over $165 million in connection with illegal, off-exchange binary option transactions on currency pairs, oil, and other commodities. The complaint charges that from at least May 1, 2013 through April 29, 2018, three Canadian brothers—defendants David Cartu, Jonathan Cartu, and Joshua Cartu—marketed, offered, and sold illegal, off-exchange binary options to retail customers on websites under the BeeOptions, Glenridge Capital, and Rumelia Capital binary option brands. According to the latest Court filings, seen by FX News Group, the CFTC has effected service on two of the ten defendants. Specifically, the Commission served Ryan Masten and BareItMedia LLC, who are citizens of the United States. The Commission’s efforts to effect service on the remaining defendants, all of whom are citizens of foreign jurisdictions, remain ongoing. Shortly after filing the Complaint, the Commission initiated service under Article 5(a) of the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters. In addition, the CFTC has mailed each foreign defendant a copy of the Complaint, Civil Cover Sheet, and Summons. The CFTC says it does not believe that any foreign jurisdiction’s Central Authority has yet effected service under the Hague Convention. Based on past experience, undersigned counsel understands that service under the Hague Convention typically takes three to six months, and may take longer under present restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Because service on eight of the ten defendants has not yet occurred, and the date by which such service will be complete is unknown, the Commission suggests that the interests of judicial economy would be served by staying the filing of the proposed scheduling order until July 15, 2021. The CFTC complaint alleges that, beginning on or before September 26, 2015, the binary option transactions offered by BeeOptions, Glenridge Capital, and Rumelia Capital were executed on an internet-based trading platform developed and operated by the Cartu brothers and Masten. As alleged in the complaint, customers of the Cartu brands, and later customers of other binary options brands operated by third-parties, accessed the Cartu platform through each individual binary brand’s website. The complaint charges that the Cartu brothers and Masten, acting through the defendant entities, controlled these transactions and manipulated the results of some trades to force customer losses and generate profits for themselves. As alleged in the complaint, the Cartu brothers also operated Greymountain Management Limited, a now-defunct “payment processor” that maintained its principal place of business in Ireland. The Cartu brothers used Greymountain to facilitate the transfer of funds from customers in the U.S. and elsewhere for illegal, off-exchange binary option transactions. Through Greymountain and other related entities, the Cartu brothers processed over $165 million in credit card payments for binary option transactions. The complaint further alleges that Masten and SignalPush provided trade signals and auto-trader services to customers, and failed to register with the CFTC as required. In its continuing litigation against the defendants, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution for the benefit of customers, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act."

Group Revenue in Q1 2021 was $203.2 million, up from Q4 2020 ($91.9m) but markedly down from a year earlier (Q1 2020: $316.6m). Group EBITDA in Q1 2021 was $121.7 million. The result was much lower than a year earlier (Q1 2020: $231.6m) but better than in Q4 2020 ($19.9m). Customer Income remained robust at $221.5m in the quarter. The result was lower than in Q1 2020 ($233.5m). It was, however, better than in Q4 2020 ($200.6m), in line with Plus500’s earlier guidance. The Company on-boarded a total of 89,406 New Customers in the quarter, up 8% compared with Q1 2020 and up 78% compared with Q4 2020 (Q1 2020: 82,951, Q4 2020: 50,314). Plus500 achieved a record quarterly number of Active Customers of 269,743 during Q1 2021, an increase of 39% compared with Q1 2020 and an increase of 25% compared with Q4 2020 (Q1 2020: 194,024, Q4 2020: 215,305), driven by the Company’s efforts and investment in customer retention. ARPU was $753 in Q1 2021 (Q1 2020: $1,632, Q4 2020: $427). AUAC reduced from the prior year and the prior quarter to $473 in Q1 2021 (Q1 2020: $641, Q4 2020: $916). The Company continues to expect that AUAC will rise steadily over time as the Company’s customer profile continues to shift to higher value customers. Importantly, Plus500 commented on the recent regulatory changes implemented by the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) for the CFD industry in Australia which came into force on 29 March 2021. Plus500 says: “While it remains at an early stage, the Board believes that the anticipated impact on the Group’s revenues of these regulatory changes is already incorporated in current compiled analysts’ consensus forecasts for Plus500. The Board continues to assess the impact of these new regulations on the business”. In terms of outlook, the Board expects FY 2021 revenue and EBITDA to be moderately ahead of current compiled analysts’ consensus forecasts. For FY 2021, revenue will be driven through further underlying strength of Customer Income, while EBITDA will be supported by Plus500’s lean, flexible cost base and efficient business model."

Less than a month after Judge Lewis J. Liman of the New York Southern District Court signed a Memorandum & Opinion granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss a complaint accusing them of market manipulation via a practice known as spoofing, the plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal with the Court. On April 2, 2021, the plaintiffs in this case – Yuri Alishaev, Robert Charles Class A, L.P., Gamma Traders – I LLC, Abraham Jeremias, Morris Jeremias, Michael Patterson, Robert L. Teel, Vega Traders LLC, submitted a notice stating that they appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Court’s March 4, 2021 Opinion and Order and March 4, 2021 Judgment dismissing this action. Let’s recall that, in this action, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants unlawfully and intentionally manipulated the price of contracts for COMEX Gold Futures, COMEX Silver Futures, NYMEX Platinum Futures, and NYMEX Palladium Futures and options on those futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX) from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2014. According to the complaint, the defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq. (the CEA), and the common law. On March 4, 2021, however, the Court sided with the defendants. The Court noted that the plaintiffs avoid pleading that, on the dates there were spoof trades, they traded after the spoof. Given the specificity of the information available to the plaintiffs in terms of the date and time of a trade, the only plausible inference is that they traded before the spoof, the Court concludes. If they traded after and proximate to the spoof, there is no reason for them not to have alleged it. And, if their trades all occurred before the spoof, there is no plausible inference that the trade took place at a price that was artificially impacted as a result of the spoof. The Court also found no basis for an inference that the plaintiffs were harmed as a result of the defendants’ alleged manipulation as opposed to having been benefitted. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ allegations that their trades occurred on the same days as the spoofs cannot establish, without more, that they suffered harm resulting from the alleged CEA violation. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim was also granted. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment must be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not alleged that they transacted directly with the defendants. The Court agreed with the defendants."

A recent status report filed by the parties in this case provides an update on the latest developments. Importantly, ThinkMarkets and Sorenson confirm that they have not had any settlement discussions to date. The Parties do not request a settlement conference at this time. Let’s recall that James Sorenson was employed by ThinkMarkets from December 14, 2015 through October 2, 2020, when he resigned to join IS Risk. ThinkMarkets alleges that prior to his departure from ThinkMarkets, Sorenson exceeded his authorized access to ThinkMarkets’ computer systems and misappropriated ThinkMarkets’ trade secrets and confidential data for use at IS Risk. Also, ThinkMarkets alleges that, by virtue of his new position at IS Risk, his conduct at the time of his departure, and other facts pertinent to Sorenson’s departure and his new role at IS Risk, Sorenson has and/or will inevitably disclose ThinkMarkets’ trade secrets to IS Risk. ThinkMarkets also claims that, for the benefit of IS Risk and to harm ThinkMarkets, Sorenson converted confidential data and communications divulging, among other things, sensitive litigation strategies and corporate practices. Sorenson is also accused of deleting an IT repository without authorization to cause harm to ThinkMarkets prior to his departure. As FX News Group has reported, Sorenson denies each of ThinkMarkets’ allegations and has moved to dismiss the complaint. In particular, Sorenson denies that he converted anything or ever improperly accessed any data, systems, communications, or any other material. The principal factual issues at this point are: Whether Sorenson removed from and possessed any information belonging to ThinkMarkets after his resignation, and if so, whether such information is confidential, proprietary, or constitutes trade secrets. Whether Sorenson exceeded his authorized access in order to obtain ThinkMarkets’ confidential information. Whether Sorenson has disclosed ThinkMarkets’ privileged, confidential, and other protected information to IS Group or otherwise. Whether and when Sorenson improperly deleted any confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information belonging to ThinkMarkets in his possession. Whether ThinkMarkets suffered any damages as a result of any of Sorenson’s alleged conduct. ThinkMarkets potentially seeks injunctive relief prohibiting Sorenson from using or disclosing ThinkMarkets’ confidential and trade secret information and an award of compensatory damages, double damages for willful misappropriation of trade secrets, punitive damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees. ThinkMarkets estimates its damages to exceed $500,000. The lawsuit continues at the Illinois Northern District Court."

The semiconductors basket consists of 30 stocks with a combined market value of $3 trillion dominated by TSMC, NVIDIA, ASML, Intel, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, and Qualcomm. The median revenue growth rate the past year has been 7.6% while earnings have grown almost 20% as prices have increased due to the rising demand and ongoing supply constraints. Samsung is the largest producer of memory chips, but Saxo has chosen to exclude the company as the main value driver of Samsung is its mobile division. Saxo’s theme baskets aim to provide as much pure exposure to the theme as possible. Sony has been excluded for the same reason as Samsung. The basket also contains Mediatek and SK Hynix which are based in Taiwan and South Korea respectively and not tradable on the SaxoTrader. Saxo explains that it has selected those two companies because of their size and importance for the industry, and because sometimes tracking the theme better is more important than all companies are tradable on the SaxoTrader. The basket is up 572% since December 2015 translating into an annualized return of 43% making the semiconductor industry one of best performing industries in the world in recent time. Past performance is of course no indicator of future performance and since Saxo select sstocks for the baskets on market value, there is always a selection and survivorship bias in the past performance measure. Therefore, investors should not look so much at past performance but instead look at present performance, the quality of the company and their outlook but deciding on which stocks to get exposure to. The key risk to the semiconductor theme basket is lower demand or rising input costs from equipment or commodities. Last week, Saxo launched its next equity theme basket covering the financial trading industry which has been turbocharged by the pandemic. In April, Saxo introduced a new theme basket focusing on crypto and blockchain companies. This basket provides inspiration and alternatives for investors that want exposure to cryptocurrencies but do not want to own ETNs or physical cryptocurrencies."

This becomes clear from a set of documents filed with the Illinois Northern District Court on May 7, 2021. This is a non-solicit and misappropriation of trade secrets case. Jeffrey French was a broker for GAA, which was acquired by StoneX Group. GAA is an Illinois limited liability company with a headquarters in Chicago. It is a financial services firm specializing in commodity trading, execution and management services. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of StoneX. StoneX Group is a successor in interest to GAA. Mr French was hired to serve GAA clients and entrusted with GAA resources and confidential information. He signed an agreement that prohibits him from soliciting GAA’s customers for two years after his employment ends. On January 29, 2021, Mr French voluntarily ended his broker relationship with GAA and, thereafter, GAA assigned new brokers to the accounts he previously serviced. According to StoneX, before leaving, Mr French compiled GAA’s trade secrets, such as customer lists, trading habits, and pricing information. And on information and belief, he is making active use of the information to solicit GAA’s customers for his own benefit. Mr French is alleged to have clandestinely contacted GAA’s customers, using GAA’s trade secrets—customer specific information, such as customer lists, trading habits, and profits and margins data—in order to solicit them for his new business, Ag Hedger. After gathering all of the GAA information he needed, establishing a new entity through which to compete, and lining up a guarantee from another entity, he resigned from GAA. On investigation, StoneX further learned of Mr French’s contacts with those customers while still working for GAA, and that French set up Ag Hedger and was at least planning to solicit clients for over six months. In this lawsuit, StoneX seeks that the Court enforce Mr French’s non-solicitation obligations, prevent the further misappropriation of GAA’s trade secrets, and prevent the irreparable harm that follows from such violations. Details of the settlement between the parties are not clear at this point. The parties have said the agreement is confidential. What FX News Group knows is that a key term (and condition) of the settlement is the entry by the Court of a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from violating the terms of Jeffrey French’s restrictive covenants at issue. Thereafter, the parties will jointly move for the dismissal of the litigation pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2)."

While Playtech’s press release proclaimed a $210 million sale – a headline which most other FX blogs basically copied and blasted out in emails and social posts – our coverage at FNG unveiled that the true sale price was less than half that amount. It seems as though the agreement between Playtech and the buyer group took nearly a year to complete because the two sides were far apart on price (frankly, not uncommon in the M&A world). Playtech eventually came down in price, but as shareholder approval is still required it decided to “package” the deal as a $210 million sale, despite the true sale price being less than half that. We explain below. Other interesting stories and trends this past week included a flurry of sports sponsorships by FX brokers, including a front-of-shirt deal with a Top-5 EPL football team, and a CySEC-licensed FX broker being banned by the FCA for sending traders to its offshore entity. Some of the top FX industry news stories to appear this week on FNG included: Playtech finalizes $101M sale of Finalto, Markets.com to Barenboim group. Well it looks like online gaming tech provider Playtech (LON:PTEC) is going to get its wish after all, and exit the Forex business. However it will not exactly be getting the $200-$250 million previously reported. After FNG reported exclusively back in August that Playtech had engaged investment bankers (UBS) to sell what it calls its Financials division – consisting mainly of the Finalto (formerly CFH Group and Alpha Capital Markets) multi-asset B2B business and the Markets.com Retail FX brokerage arm – and then another exclusive FNG report in January that Playtech had identified a buyer for Finalto with a deal being negotiated in the $200 million range, the company announced this morning that an agreement had been finalized which will see Finalto / Markets.com offloaded. FCA orders EverFX to stop offering CFDs to UK customers. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) today announces that it has taken action to stop a Cypriot-based firm, ICC Intercertus Capital Ltd, and other members of its group which trade as EverFX, from offering high risk CFDs to UK investors. The EverFX Group used the fact that ICC Intercertus was regulated in the UK to convey legitimacy. However, many consumers were subsequently induced to transact with overseas members of the EverFX Group, which had no authorisation to provide regulated services in the UK meaning that consumers lacked the same level of protection. The FCA identified serious concerns with the sales and marketing practices of the EverFX Group, including the use of misleading financial promotions, failing to inform consumers about the nature and risks of CFDs, applying pressure to invest additional funds, instructing clients on which trades to make, and failing to allow customers to withdraw funds. Retail FX broker FBS signs as shirt sponsor of Leicester City. English Premier League team Leicester City has announced that it has signed a new three-year agreement with global online trading company FBS as its principal club partner.

The parties said that the partnership will bring together the 2015/16 Premier League champions and 2021 FA Cup winners with one of the world’s fastest-growing financial services companies. IG becomes official partner of England Cricket. IG, a global leader in online trading and investments, has today been announced as an Official Partner of England Cricket. The partnership will see IG support both the men’s and women’s teams, with the IG logo appearing on the men’s shirt across all three formats of the game. As a company that empowers ambitious individuals to pursue their own investing strategies, IG is excited to work with the ECB as it seeks to inspire generations through elite performance, increased accessibility and a commitment to its communities. The partnership gives IG the perfect platform on which to build awareness of its brand and range of investment products, as well as widespread opportunities to create inspiring experiences for its clients and further the goals of its Brighter Future initiative.

We had reported last August that CySEC reached a settlement with Rodeler, which operated the 24option.com and 24fx.com retail brokerage brand websites as CySEC licensed entities. The settlement saw Rodeler pay a fine of €280,000 to the Cyprus Treasury, in regards to violations of its CySEC CIF license. And that settlement came after Rodeler and another CIF-holder under common ownership, TradeATF parent Hoch Capital Ltd, voluntarily renounced their CySEC CIF licenses. The “voluntary” moves followed trouble that both brokers got into with UK regulator The FCA at the beginning of June. As Cyprus licensed financial companies both 24option and TradeATF were able to “passport” their licenses into the UK and all other EU countries, and operate offices in those locations as well as take retail clients from those jurisdictions. However The FCA banned 24option and TradeATF (and some other CySEC licensed brands) from the UK, in a first-of-its-kind move against passporting brokers. The FCA cited issues such as unauthorised celebrity endorsements on social media to entice consumers into scams involving CFDs. In addition, the regulator noted that the firms had failed to pay money owed to investors, charged customers undisclosed fees, and failed to tell them about the risks of trading CFDs. Rodeler Ltd had operated 24option, as its name implies, as a Binary Options brokerage, but later transitioned to become a “standard” FX and CFDs broker. It appears as if 24option is continuing to operate website 24option.com as an offshore Belize incorporated entity called Richfield Capital Limited."

The company said that the new license and offshore presence allows it to offer its services to even more clients in a regulated and secure way. Koula Lamprou, Chief Financial Officer of easyMarkets said: “At easyMarkets, we always try to find ways to give our clients an exceptional trading experience. Oversight, regulation and security are indivisible parts of that. Our new BVI license adds to our already robust list of licenses that include European oversight by ESMA and CySEC, Australian ASIC license for our APAC based activities and FSA licence for global/international clients. We have been operating uninterrupted in the trading industry for 20 years and one of our missions has always been to grow our regulatory framework which better serves our clients.” Over the past year we have witnessed an increasing phenomenon of (mainly) EU and UK licensed online brokers opening up offshore entities in jurisdictions such as the BVI, Seychelles, Bahamas, Mauritius, and St. Vincent & The Grenadines, from where they can offer more generous trading terms (read: higher leverage, deposit bonuses) to retail traders which are no longer allowed in Europe and Australia. Founded in 2001 and based in Cyprus where it is licensed by CySEC, easyMarkets also has regulated operations in Australia (Easy Markets Pty Ltd – ASIC AFS license No. 246566), in the Republic of Seychelles (Financial Services Authority of Seychelles – License Number SD056) and now as noted in British Virgin Islands by the BVI Financial Services Commission – License Number (EF Worldwide Ltd – License Number SIBA/L/20/1135). easyMarkets recently signed a deal to become the Official Online Trading Partner of popular Spanish football club Real Madrid."

ASIC stated that the Federal Court has ordered Forex Capital Trading Pty Ltd (Forex CT) to pay a $20 million penalty for engaging in systemic unconscionable conduct, paying conflicted remuneration to its team leaders and account managers and failing to act in the best interests of its clients. The company’s sole director, Shlomo Yoshai, has also been ordered to pay a $400,000 penalty and disqualified from managing corporations for eight years for breaching his duties as a director and aiding Forex CT’s unconscionable conduct. Forex CT offered clients opportunities to trade in contracts-for-difference (CFDs) and margin foreign exchange contracts issued by the firm. Forex CT engaged in a system of unconscionable conduct by: – offering incentives to encourage clients to transfer more money to their Forex CT trading account, even after the client had told the account manager that they could not afford to invest more money, or were reluctant to do so; – employing high pressure sales tactics; – recommending inappropriate trading strategies to clients; – making misleading or deceptive representations to clients; – implementing and encouraging a trading floor culture that was directed towards maximising trading volume and client deposits rather than promoting a culture of compliance with applicable legal requirements; – implementing an employee remuneration scheme and key performance indicators where account managers were rewarded and paid commissions based on net deposits (gross deposits less withdrawals) made by their clients; and – failing to ensure compliance with financial services laws. The Court also found Forex CT failed to act in the best interests of its clients when providing personal advice and failed to do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by the license were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly. ASIC’s investigation revealed that Forex CT had a trading floor culture geared towards maximising trading volume and client deposits rather than complying with the law. As we reported in our coverage back in May, the regulator noted that a bell or a gong was rung at Forex CT when clients deposited funds of certain amounts into their trading accounts and account managers could participate in incentive ‘games’ such as ‘wheel of fortune’, roulette tables and dice games to win cash if certain client deposit targets were met. In handing down his decision, His Honour Justice Middleton found that, ‘Forex CT had “systemic compliance deficiencies” and a culture of non-compliance’ and said that ‘the vast losses incurred by clients support the imposition of a significant pecuniary penalty.’ The Court also found that the affected clients were vulnerable with little or no trading experience. Some of the individual clients were in circumstances of financial stress, and others were, at times, relying on credit or superannuation savings to fund deposits to their trading accounts. In disqualifying Mr Yoshai for eight years, His Honour described Mr Yoshai’s behaviour as ‘incompetent and irresponsible.’ ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour said: ‘The significant penalty handed down by the Court reflects the seriousness of this conduct. If corporations disregard the law and their client obligations, ASIC will take action and the consequences can be severe.’ Background ASIC cancelled Forex CT’s AFS license after its investigation found Forex CT’s financial services business model disregarded key obligations of an AFS licensee and resulted in unconscionable conduct, misleading and deceptive conduct and a failure to manage conflicts of interest. On 19 March 2019, ASIC obtained orders in the Federal Court restraining Forex CT from transferring any property, including client money, overseas. The orders restraining Forex CT from transferring property overseas were subsequently amended requiring Forex CT to seek ASIC’s approval in writing prior to making any overseas payments and extended by consent until 5pm on 18 June 2021. ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Forex CT and Mr Yoshai on 16 July 2020. ASIC banned Steven Marsh, a former employee of Forex CT, in June 2020 from providing financial services for a period of three years. In March 2021, ASIC banned Forex CT sole director Shlomo Yoshai from engaging in financial services for 10 years, former team leaders Jarrod Popuard for six years and Benjamin Esler for four-and-a-half years, and former account managers Huy Minh (Andy) Hoang for five years and Andrew Tran for three years. Mr Yoshai filed an application for review of ASIC’s banning decision with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 6 April 2021. The size of the Australian market for OTC retail derivatives has grown considerably over recent years. With that growth, there has been a dramatic increase in complaints to ASIC in relation to conduct within the OTC retail derivatives market. ASIC stated that it has and will continue to take strong regulatory action to protect consumers of these products."

To declare a final dividend of 21.43 pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2021, payable on 9 September 2021 to holders of ordinary shares in the company named on the Register of Members as at the close of business on 6 August 2021. 3.

The Board considers that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders as a whole. The CMC Markets’ Board says it will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of them.

Net operating income increased to £409.8 million, up £157.8 million (63%) from the result recorded in the preceding year. As guided earlier, the result was ahead of forecasts. CFD revenue per active client rose 22% to £4,560, driven by improved CFD client income retention, whereas the number of CFD active clients increased by 19,389 (34%) partially driven by increased levels of interest in the financial markets from a new wave of clients. Stockbroking net trading revenue jumped 72% to £54.8 million supported by higher client numbers (up 28%) and the increasing appeal of the international shares offering."

Richard Dyason brings 30 years of management experience in the financial services sector to his new role.

First to the numbers… NAGA Group, which operates the CySEC-licensed NAGA.com site, stated that in 2020 the company brought in a total output (their word for Revenues) of EUR 26.3 million (previous year: EUR 8.4 million), NAGA achieved the turnaround in the record year 2020 with platform trading revenues of EUR 24.3 million (previous year: EUR 5.6 million), a group EBITDA of EUR 6.6 million (previous year: EUR -9.2 million) and a consolidated annual net profit of EUR 2.0 million (previous year: EUR -13.4 million loss). While 2020 was much improved over 2019 at NAGA – and NAGA’s share price responded by rising more than 600% in calendar 2020 – the company stated that the Management Board confirms the group sales forecast issued at the beginning of the year of an increase to EUR 50 million to EUR 52 million, and a group EBITDA of EUR 13 million to EUR 15 million. After an already-reported Q1-2021 at NAGA with Revenue at USD 13.7 million and EBITDA of USD 3.7 million, it seems as though the stay-the-course forecast somewhat disappointed the market, which was expecting continued growth. (Q1 was reported before full-year 2020 results as the full-year results need to be audited, which took more time this year due mainly to COVID related issues, more on that below). The company added that management’s strategy to market NAGA globally through increased investments in marketing and sales and the focus on customer support and platform quality has led to significant growth. As of December 31, 2020, the number of customers increased by 72% to 43,646. The number of active users more than doubled, while the number of transactions rose by 117% to over 6.3 million and the trading volume tripled to EUR 120 billion. Another highlight is the strong increase in transactions resulted primarily from copy trading. More than 1.7 million trades were copied at NAGA in 2020, which corresponds to a growth of more than 142%. In 2021, NAGA said that it is accelerating its investments specifically in marketing, sales and geographic expansion in order to increase awareness of the NAGA group of companies and their innovative products. In addition to existing branches in Cyprus, China, Thailand and Nigeria, NAGA is aiming to start business in Australia, South Africa and Vietnam this year, after licensing. In the coming quarters, NAGA said it will announce further product updates in order to further improve the platform quality and user experience, alongside the go-live of its payment app NAGA Pay. The company also informed about a delay in regard to the completion of the audit and the publication of the 2020 consolidated financial statements. The background are primarily COVID-19-related delays in the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements in Cyprus, which was classified as a high-risk area for several months during the audit period. This made it considerably more difficult to carry out the on-site visits required as part of the audit. The Management Board expects to publish the 2020 consolidated financial statements in the course of July and assures that this is purely a process-related delay and not an audit-related delay. NAGA Group shares are still up 47% on the year, but at €5.95 have fallen by 36% since hitting an all-time high of €9.30 in early February. NAGA Group AG shares, 2021 year-to-date.

Net operating income increased to £409.8 million, up £157.8 million (63%) from the result recorded in the preceding year. As guided earlier, the result was ahead of forecasts. CFD revenue per active client rose 22% to £4,560, driven by improved CFD client income retention, whereas the number of CFD active clients increased by 19,389 (34%) partially driven by increased levels of interest in the financial markets from a new wave of clients. Stockbroking net trading revenue jumped 72% to £54.8 million supported by higher client numbers (up 28%) and the increasing appeal of the international shares offering. The broker continued its investment in proprietary technology platforms to diversify the offering, with new Dynamic Trading and Spot FX offerings launched in May and June 2021 respectively, along with a native mobile app for Stockbroking in March 2021. Operating expenses increased by 22% to £184.0 million, predominantly due to higher personnel costs as a result of recruitment to support ongoing strategic initiatives, increased marketing costs to capitalise on market opportunities, and trading related variable costs. Profit before tax increased 127% to £224.0 million (2020: £98.7 million). Across regions, CMC Markets’ established markets consist of the UK, Germany and Australia, geographies where it still sees good opportunities for growth and appetite for its offering. The UK region displayed strong growth in the year, with record increase in active clients of 45% to 20,077, with the launch of Dynamic Trading in May 2021 and Spot FX in June 2021 responding directly to client requests and positioning the Group for further growth. In Germany, the Group saw a record increase in active clients, resulting in strong growth. CMC Markets’ Australian business continues to perform very well with CFD net trading revenue during the year rising to £100.3 million, which now accounts for 29% of CFD net trading revenue for the Group. The Group says it is well prepared for, and welcoming of, the ASIC measures and the company does not believe they will have a material impact on revenue in the medium term. The stockbroking business also continues to display strong growth. In terms of outlook, the Board remains confident in achieving net operating income in excess of £330 million for 2022. The Group’s significant investment in technology development, including the build of a non-leveraged trading platform for UK clients, is expected to lead to a moderate increase in operating costs in the coming financial year. CMC Markets declared a final dividend of 21.43 pence per share (total dividend of 30.63 pence per share), in line with the dividend policy. The Board remains committed to paying a total dividend of 50% of profit after tax, balancing investing in long-term success and providing shareholders with superior returns."

That definition includes (and seems to be mainly aimed at) forex trading, crypto trading, and CFD trading, alongside a longer list such as credit cards, buy now pay later services, bail bonds, and debt consolidation services. TikTok creators can still post their own content on financial services, such as views on trading forex and crypto or specific shares and indices. The ban just applies to Branded Content. TikTok defines Branded Content as content where the creator receives something of value from a third party in exchange for the post, to promote that brand’s products or service. It could be a brand endorsement, partnership or other kind of promotion for a product or service. This could include content which features or references a product or service which has been gifted by a third party, or for which the creator has been paid to post about, whether in the form of money or a gift. It also includes posts for which the creator will receive a commission from the third party if other users purchase the product or service, whether via an affiliate link or by the user using a promotional code. Branded Content also includes content for which the creator has a commercial relationship with the brand, such as a brand ambassador. Top TikTok’ers with tens of millions of followers such as Charli D’Amelio can reportedly earn upwards of USD $100,000 per Branded Content post, adding up to tens of millions of dollars a year. TikTok has seen a major uptick in Financial content over the past year, both of the branded and non-branded kind, in parallel with the global upswing in retail financial and crypto trading. Apparently TikTok was receiving an increased number of complaints regarding Branded Content scams, and took action by adding all Financial content to the Branded Content ban. Thus, forex and crypto trading joins a long list of banned Branded Content on TikTok that includes alcohol, cigarettes, dating services, weapons, food supplements and vitamins, pharmaceuticals, gambling, and political content, among other areas."

There are some hybrid analysis tools that well-informed CFD traders should pay careful attention to; they’re are a mixture of technical and fundamental analysis. With these hybrid widgets and apps, you get the visual illustration that a technical indicator offers, combined with and supported by the fundamental reasons a trend develops. The Admirals Heat Map is a real-time, hybrid analysis tool that all traders, whatever their levels of experience or skill, should consider applying to their trading method and strategy. The widget is easy to follow and simple to activate, and it provides a snapshot of the financial instruments on the move and how much they’ve risen or fallen. When the Heat Map gets used in conjunction with the Admirals sentiment index widget, traders can obtain an excellent visual representation of market behaviour. The mapping is beneficial for day, swing and position traders who like to take a second look at all the available data and analysis before clicking the buy or sell button. The widget illustrates the top daily movers in the equities market, information that can provide you with plenty of exciting trading opportunities. Market movement always attracts interest from the trading community, both traders and investors; therefore, crowd behaviour could increase the current sentiment and the trade direction. The directional movement can gain strength with increased volatility, and this is when the Heat Map lights up with suggestions. If you’re considering trading the most popular equities, the Heat Map provides essential information to ensure you’re on the right side of the market when you make your trading decision. If all your other analysis and trade execution criteria get met, the Heat Map can serve as your final decision-maker. Key features and benefits · You can use the market radar function to track price movements. · View the most significant market movements and trends, to the upside and downside. · Remain aware of both long and short trading opportunities. · Daily trends, volatility and other vital metrics are visible on the Heat Map. All the data used in the Heat Map gets harvested in real-time from the Admirals Flagship Trade.MT4 account. Top Share Market Movers The mapping highlights the top daily movers, saving you the time needed to screen several markets simultaneously, putting you in the ideal position to plan your trading decisions. The mapping reveals the key movers over the past 24 hours and during the last trading session, enabling CFD traders to figure out the daily trend and analyse if a medium-term swing could develop. If you’re looking to trade stocks, the mapping software delivers the name of the stock using its ticker, the current price and the percentage size of the rise or fall. For example, on June 1, Microsoft (MSFT) fell by 0.92%, and the closing price was 247.32. On the same day, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) slumped by 2.20%, and the closing price was 165.53. From a fundamental perspective, the falls were due to several reasons. The NASDAQ sold off as United States’ inflation fears still refuse to fade, and doubts surfaced concerning the efficacy of the latest JNJ one-time CV-19 vaccine and its acceptance. Don’t miss opportunities Now the problem most retail traders have is that after spending considerable time poring over the data and research to arrive at their decision, the opportunity has gone; this is where the Heat Map can help you bank those profits. You get instant notification of the rise or fall in real-time, and you can then quickly decide if there’s any momentum left in the movement. You don’t have to over-analyse or procrastinate. The data is there in real-time, proving which stocks or FX currency pairs are on the move. The Heat Map also works well in the FX market The mapping excels when used to gauge the movements of equities or FX currency pairs. Some charts reveal the most volatile pairs on the day. Forex traders know how important it is to find which pairs are trading outside their most recent ranges; the Heat Map illustrates these patterns very effectively. The mapping comes in the form of a blotter. You can quickly establish which pairs have moved outside their earlier range and how much in percentage terms. Like the software used to highlight stock moves, the most volatile currencies are shown for the latest session and over the past 24 hrs. But the FX mapping goes a stage further to illustrate 48 hr movements and the complete two-day cycle. In summary, the Heat Map provided by Admirals is another winning tool in their recently expanded box. Used in the right way, it can aid your trading decisions. It’s not a standalone feature. The full range of benefits gets unlocked if you use it as part of a comprehensive fundamental and technical analysis strategy. Used with the Admirals sentiment tool, and when combined with other technical indicators, while remaining aware of the fundamentals of a stock or FX pair, should put you in the ideal position to capitalise. https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/market-heat-map About Admirals    Founded in 2001, Admirals is a multi-award-winning online financial broker offering competitive spreads and low commission charges.

But that is exactly what Tickmill CMO Nicholas Baumer did, joining the fast-growing Tickmill at the end of last year. Now that Nicholas has had the better part of half a year under his belt at Tickmill, we thought that it would be a good time to catch up with him and get his views on the FX sector, and of course what is going on at Tickmill. FNG: Hi Nicholas, and thanks for joining us today. It has been the better part of six months since you joined Tickmill as CMO. How have the first few months gone, and what have you learned and observed during your time there so far? Nicholas: Thanks for having me, Gerald. The first months have been great. The Tickmill family has been very welcoming so I was able to settle in quickly. Illimar and I spoke extensively at the beginning about strategy and goals so I had a good feel for what needed to be done. It’s always very interesting to join a new company and see how things are done differently from previous experiences. Many things have stood out, but the main points that really caught my attention were the local country presence and the work done by our brokerage department to deliver the excellent trading conditions people have come to expect from the Tickmill brand. Tickmill operates globally and we have local offices and colleagues in various places. This has been a big help for marketing and it has helped establish ourselves as a trusted local trading partner for many. It helps us get that local feeling right and better understand what the trading community is like in each market. When it comes to trading, our trading conditions are second to none. We have some of the best spreads out there so it’s really just about pushing out that message and being transparent with people so they can see it for themselves. If you have great trading conditions and great customer support with a trusted regulated broker, what more do you need? FNG: Now that you’ve had some time to prioritize, what are the key projects you’re working on now at Tickmill? Nicholas: It’s been busy the last few months. We just ventured back into the crypto space with new crypto assets available to trade. We are also preparing our MT5 launch coming in August and with MT5 will come a new equities offering as well. Outside of CFD’s, we have been working very hard on our exchange traded derivatives offering since January and while it is still relatively early, it’s interesting to see the high level of interest in the futures product. We’ve partnered with the CME group who are the largest player in the futures and options space and their E-mini and micro products are very relevant to our target audience. It’s important we keep listening to our customers and develop new services like private strategy groups that provide value to our customers. FNG: How has it been to both change jobs, and manage, through the COVID pandemic? Nicholas: COVID has definitely complicated things from a relationship building perspective as everyone has been working from home for the most part so really getting to know people has taken more time. I’ve also missed the impromptu nature of being together at an office where you can discuss ideas or sketch out new ideas spontaneously. Team culture is very important to me but it’s hard to maintain virtually. That being said, we do have strong processes in place and operationally things are running well. I’ve been very impressed with the professionalism of our marketing team so this has helped tremendously with the transition. FNG: While Retail FX brokers generally, and Tickmill specifically, had a strong 2020 financially, what effects have you observed on the industry through COVID? Especially in Cyprus, which as a culture and economy is so dependent on packed flights and tourists? Nicholas: As you mentioned, 2020 was actually a very strong year for many brokers so it was in many ways a period of intense growth. We’ve seen many new people discover trading for the 1st time and enter the markets which made a good educational offering even more important by organizing more webinars for example. I think COVID has also shown many companies that working from home is viable and some combination of office and home will be necessary in the future to attract top talent. The offline meetings and events on the other hand were impacted negatively. While most of what we do is digital nowadays, in many places in the world meeting in person is still a necessity to further solidify business relationships. Expo’s and private events were always a great way for us to meet our clients and partners. However I can see light at the end of the tunnel and we will be in Dubai 2 times this year at 2 different expo’s. We have also started organizing small workshops and seminars again, local regulations permitting of course, and you can see clients really appreciating that. FNG: What else can we expect to hear from Tickmill in the coming months? Nicholas: Our updated service offering with equities, crypto’s and MT5 alongside our great trading conditions will be talked about quite a bit in the upcoming weeks and months. We will be working on improving our partnership program which is already pretty great. We’re also very excited to start rolling out our new mobile app soon and last but not least, we are very much looking forward to launching our futures product in more countries in Europe and around the world."

Net trading revenue for FY21 was up 31% year-on-year to £853.4 million (FY20: £649.2 million). Excluding one-time hedging costs associated with the financing of the tastytrade acquisition, adjusted net trading revenue was £861.3 million. Total active clients rose 31% to 313,300 (FY20: 239,600) and new clients onboarded rose 39% to 134,800 (FY20: 96,900). IG now services a substantially larger client base going into FY22. FY21 OTC leveraged revenue was £798.2 million, 29% higher than FY20, reflecting a 22% increase in the number of active OTC leveraged clients and a 6% increase in the average revenue per client. There were 216,300 active OTC leveraged clients in FY21. During the extreme market volatility in Q4 FY20, the Group onboarded a significant number of new clients, many of whom continued to trade throughout FY21. New client acquisition continued to be strong throughout FY21, with an additional 85,100 new active clients onboarded, a 19% increase on FY20. New OTC leveraged clients generated £162.5 million in revenue compared with £125.3 million in FY20, an increase of 30%. Average revenue per client was £3,690, 6% higher than FY20, reflecting an increase in the level of client trading, noting that FY20 was heavily skewed by the significant increase in trading in Q4, whereas average revenue per OTC leveraged client has been steady across each quarter of FY21. Revenue from stock trading and investments was £38.7 million in FY21, up 184% on FY20, reflecting a 63% increase in the number of stock trading clients served by the Group and a 74% increase in the average revenue per client. Throughout FY21 the stock trading client base grew each month driven by a significant and sustained increase in new active clients, with 51,400 onboarded, an increase of 98% on FY20. Revenue from exchange traded derivatives in FY21 was £24.4 million, 33% higher than FY20. Of this, £19.5 million was from Nadex, the Group’s US retail-focused exchange, an increase of 10% on FY20. This was driven by a 28% increase in the number of active clients, with average revenue per client down 14%. Spectrum, the pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) which launched in October 2019 (FY20), delivered £4.9 million revenue compared with £0.6 million in FY20. During FY21, 3,800 new clients were onboarded, an increase of 44% on FY20. UK and EU revenue in FY21 was £420.1 million, 28% higher than in FY20. The significant increase in revenue was driven by the 18% increase in the number of active clients trading, the result of good retention of the existing client base and the acquisition of 39,900 new active clients in the period, 17% higher than FY20. The revenue increase was most significant in IG’s retail client segment, driven by record new client acquisition, resulting in an 18% increase in active clients and a 29% increase in the average revenue per client. IG’s professional client segment also saw a 5% increase in active clients and a 2% increase in revenue per client. Revenue from Australia increased by 36% to £119.7 million, benefitting from a 12% increase in the active client base, and a 21% increase in revenue per client. In FY21 we acquired 10,100 new clients, an increase of 9% on FY20. On 29 March 2021, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) leverage restrictions were introduced. The impact on revenue in the last two months of FY21 was in line with expectations. Singapore revenue was £74.5 million, 31% higher than FY20, reflecting a 12% increase in the number of active clients and a 17% increase in revenue per client. Acquisition was strong with 4,300 new clients onboarded, an increase of 5% on FY20. EMEA non-EU revenue, which includes the Group’s offices in Switzerland, Dubai and South Africa, was £56.5 million, 5% higher than FY20, with an 8% increase in active clients and a 3% reduction in revenue per client. Performance in this region, particularly in Switzerland and Dubai, is more concentrated in a small number of higher-value clients, and these markets did not see the same benefit from the increased new client demand and increased client activity as the broader Core Markets businesses. The Board have proposed a final dividend of 30.24 pence per share, which would maintain the Group’s full-year cash dividend for FY21 at 43.2 pence per share as guided previously."

FXCM UK, based in London and the FXCM Group’s central operating entity, did continue to see an erosion of revenue, down 7.5% YoY from $16.7 million to $15.5 million, but significant cost cutting efforts bore fruit with the effects seen on the bottom line. Administrative expenses fell by $8.2 million to $14.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019 ($22.9 million). Much of this was a reduction in inter-group expenses but there were also savings in professional, regulatory and prime brokerage fees. Client cash held also declined, from $232 million in 2019 to $174 million as at year-end 2020, mostly due to some higher value clients reducing cash held with the company during the period. Retail trading volumes at FXCM UK increased by 11% YoY thanks to heightened volatility in 2020, averaging $50 billion monthly (2019: $45 billion). FXCM UK offers online FX and CFD trading to its retail and professional clients utilising the online trading platforms of affiliated companies. The company offsets all of its FX and CFD trades with affiliate entities and is compensated for selling this risk on a commission basis. In this capacity, the company is acting as a referring broker to these entities and is the principal counterparty to the client transaction. The profit or loss for the company is dependent on the trading volume of its clients. Looking forward, FXCM UK said that it will continue to pursue key initiatives to retain and grow its client base in 2021. The company’s objectives for 2021 are to optimise revenues from current and new business, while strengthening the FXCM Group brand. To optimise revenues, the company aims to improve conversion rates of new account applicants and decrease the time it takes between applying for a new account and placing a first trade. FXCM UK said that it is re-evaluating how client trade flows are managed, relying less on a small number of metrics and more on technologies which provide a holistic view into client trading patterns. In addition, the introduction of a significant number of new tradeable products are expected to generate renewed interest from the FX and CFD industry (e.g. proprietary stock basket lines). FXCM is a Leucadia Company, part of Jefferies Financial (NYSE:JEF). FXCM UK’s income statement and balance sheet for 2020 follow:"

The Spreadex Sports logo will be worn by Clarets players across the home, away and third kits during Burnley’s sixth consecutive top flight campaign. The new 2021-22 kits will be revealed later this week, while Spreadex said it will work closely with the club on a range of community and charity-based initiatives across the course of the season. The multi-million-pound shirt deal also includes rights, such as LED perimeter board advertising, player access across the season, and presence across Burnley’s website, CRM and social media channels. Spreadex is the only company in the world to offer customers access to traditional sportsbook betting as well as sports spread betting and financial trading. The firm, which now employs more than 150 staff at its headquarters in St Albans, has been operating since 1999 and is regulated by both the Gambling Commission and Financial Conduct Authority due to its unique product offering. Spreadex saw an 8% decline in Revenue in 2020, £49.1 million versus £53.3 million in 2019, with a decline in sports activity somewhat offset by increased financial spreadbetting. Spreadex CEO Dave MacKenzie said: “We are delighted to join the Burnley FC family as main sponsor at an exciting time in both the club’s and our own futures. “This deal reflects the ambitious growth plans Spreadex has as a company, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with a superbly-run club with such an established history and reputation. “Burnley’s values and ambitions echo our own, and we’re looking forward to supporting the club throughout the 2021/2022 season both on and off the pitch.” The firm said it will also be running a range of fan engagement activities through its digital channels, including ticket competitions, opportunities to win signed shirts and other exciting promotions. Ella Cummins, Burnley FC’s Head of Commercial Partnerships, added: “We are delighted to welcome Spreadex as our new principal partner and have been impressed with the commitment they have already shown supporting fan initiatives and giving back to the community. We look forward to working together over the coming season on some exciting campaigns and are thrilled Spreadex has chosen Burnley Football Club for their first sports partnership.” Burnley Football Club has also pledged to donate £5 for every third-choice shirt sold towards Alzheimer’s Society, which Spreadex will match. Ella Cummins continued: “We’re very proud of the pledge to donate £5 each for every third-choice shirt sold which will provide support for those affected by dementia following the devasting effects COVID has had on people up and down the country.” “We know this is a cause close to Burnley fans’ hearts and we’ll be working closely with Alzheimer’s Society this season on projects to continue this important conversation.” Players will wear the new home kit for the first time in a pre-season game against Oldham Athletic on July 24."

Robinhood reported that it holds $81 billion of client assets (as of March 31, 2021) up from just $14 billion as at year-end 2019. The pandemic era has clearly been very good for Robinhood. Interestingly, Robinhood noted that more than 50% of its 18 million customers were first-time investors. The company reported that there were 17.7 million active users on the platform in the latest month for which figures are available (March 2021). The company believes that close to 50% of all new retail funded accounts opened in the United States from 2016 to 2021 were new accounts created on Robinhood, based on new account data from publicly reporting peer brokerages. Robinhood didn’t give any indication as to the valuation it expects, or the size of the offering, but market buzz is that it will be in the $40 billion range. In its last financing round earlier this year Robinhood raised $3.4 billion valuing the company at about $12-13 billion. Robinhood rival eToro announced plans to go public, via a SPAC merger, at a valuation of just over $10 billion. Robinhood said that its mission is to democratize finance for all. The company was founded on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in the financial system, and thus the founders set out to create a modern financial services platform for everyone, regardless of their wealth, income or background. Systemic barriers to investing, like expensive commissions, minimum balance requirements and complicated, jargon-filled paperwork, have dissuaded millions of people from feeling welcome or able to participate until now. Robinhood said that it has set out to change this. It uses technology to deliver a new way for people to interact with the financial system. The company believes investing should be familiar and welcoming, with a simple design and an intuitive interface, so that customers are empowered to achieve their goals. It believes that the Robinhood app now makes investing approachable for millions. Indeed, Robinhood has been successful not only in building its own business but in changing the retail brokerage industry in the US and worldwide. The company forced the hand of most its older US rivals – E*Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity – to drop per-trade commissions. It also inspired a number of “Robinhood rival” firms in countries around the world. In its filing Robinhood also noted its cultural impact. The company pioneered commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which the rest of the industry emulated. The company claimed that over half of 18-44 year olds in the United States know who Robinhood is according to an internal brand study conducted in March 2021. As a further sign of its relevance today, Robinhood reached the number-one spot on the Apple App Store multiple times in the first quarter of 2021 and was frequently ranked number one in the Finance category on the Apple App store during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The Robinhood platform, which began as a U.S. stock-focused retail brokerage, currently offers: • trading in U.S. listed stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), as well as related options and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”); • cryptocurrency trading through subsidiary Robinhood Crypto, LLC (“RHC”); • fractional share trading, which enables customers—regardless of budget—to build a diversified portfolio and access stocks previously out of reach; • recurring investments, which help customers make investing routine and employ dollar-cost averaging; • Cash Management, which includes Robinhood-branded debit cards and enables customers to save and spend by paying bills, writing checks, earning interest, withdrawing funds via ATMs and receiving Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) pass-through insurance on cash swept from their brokerage account; and • Robinhood Gold, a monthly paid subscription service that provides customers with premium features, such as enhanced instant access to deposits, professional research, Nasdaq Level II market data and, upon approval, access to margin investing. The Robinhood IPO is being led by investment bank Goldman Sachs. The company plans to list on NADSAQ using the ticker symbol HOOD. Robinhood’s IPO (S-1) filing can be seen here."

As part of the agreement, SBI has also moved its trading facility into smartTrade’s Tokyo data center to ensure its infrastructure is constantly monitored and refreshed as their business grows, as well as to take advantage of smartTrade’s fully managed services including enhanced security and redundancy capabilities. The expansion comes as both retail and institutional interest in cryptocurrency trading continues to soar in the Japanese market.

Three years later SBI added smartTrade’s pricing and distribution modules to grow its business outside Japan and provide liquidity to the rest of Asia. David Vincent, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of smartTrade Technologies, said: “This unprecedented and volatile year demonstrated the need for high performance trading infrastructure capable of withstanding all circumstances.

Today’s announcement is a vote of confidence that we will continue to work together with our customers to deliver them the infrastructure they need to succeed.” Itsushi Morimoto, Executive Director, SBI Liquidity Market, said: “SBI has been utilizing smartTrade’s Connectivity, Aggregation and Distribution system for years to power our foreign exchange business. We are pleased to grow this relationship as we increasingly work to meet our clients growing requirements and desire to trade in a wide variety of digital currencies. smartTrade has been the best kind of partner – one that adapts with the business, supporting our change and growth.” SBI Liquidity Market is a part of the SBI Group (TYO:8473), Japan’s largest on-line financial conglomerate, that provides various FX and derivatives services for the Group and external clients."

This is actually not Usain Bolt’s first foray into retail forex – while he was still active as a runner he was named a Brand Ambassador for Cyprus based broker XM.com in 2016. The AvaTrade announcement was made, not surprisingly, during the Olympics and on the day after the men’s 100 meter race, one of the Olympics’ key events and the race in which Mr. Bolt – still the world’s fastest man and 100m record holder – starred for many years. Dáire Ferguson, CEO at AvaTrade, said of the new partnership with Mr. Bolt: “Investors and athletes require a number of similar characteristics. They need to be driven, quick to react and dynamic to get to the top. This is why we’re so excited to be working alongside Usain Bolt, an individual who shares our views and outlook on what is required to achieve success. “Over the past few weeks, we have been inspired by the sporting excellence and professionalism shown by so many dedicated athletes, it makes it all more exciting for AvaTrade to join forces with one of the most iconic sportsmen of all time. “As one of the most regulated and trusted brokers in the industry, we are delighted to have Usain Bolt representing our brand and working with us to promote our commitment in making trading accessible for everyone around the globe with our excellent customer support, educational guides, cutting-edge technology and intuitive platforms.” Commenting on the partnership, Usain Bolt added: “As a world-record breaker in the Olympics and World Championships, I’m always inspired by companies that are innovative and lead the way in their industry. AvaTrade provides the access and tools you need to take advantage of trading opportunities in real time, so I am very excited to work with AvaTrade and help them expand their brand to many more millions of investors world-wide. Be more Bolt!” AvaTrade is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, and also has licensed subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa, Japan, the UAE, and Israel. The company reportedly hired investment bankers earlier this year to pursue an IPO of the company, that could value AvaTrade at up to £700 million.

The order finds that all three defendants are liable for solicitation fraud in connection with forex transactions, Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) fraud, as well as multiple CFTC registration violations. The order requires SSLS and Mayer to pay $3,712,035.93 in restitution jointly and severally and SSL to pay $198,143.03 in restitution. The order further imposes $9,798,107.79 in civil monetary penalties on SSLS; $9,798,107.79 on SSL; and $1,338,000 on Mayer. Additionally, under the order, defendants are permanently enjoined from engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), registering with the CFTC, and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. The order resolves a CFTC enforcement case filed on June 11, 2020. Case Background In the order, U.S. District Judge Robert P. Boulee found that from at least July 2018 to March 2019, the defendants fraudulently solicited customers to open discretionary trading accounts, and offered to trade those accounts, through a fully automated retail foreign currency (forex) trading software system that Mayer created. The order further finds that the defendants solicited customers through online videos, social media, and in-person marketing events. As found in the order, the solicitations contained material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Mayer’s qualifications and trading experience. Additionally, as found in the order, the defendants misrepresented the forex trading system’s performance history and expected trading profits. Further, as found in the order, the defendants failed to disclose that Mayer never opened a live trading account using the forex trading system. The order further found that Mayer failed to register as an associated person of a CTA; and that SSL and SSLS unlawfully permitted Mayer to become or remain associated with them. Related CFTC Enforcement Action In a previous, related case, the CFTC found that SSL and SSLS acted as unregistered CTAs, and that two former officers acted as unregistered associated persons of both SSL and SSLS."

When discussing technical indicators for trading financial markets, we immediately think about the technical indicators placed on our trading charts. Indicators such as Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI and PSAR have become increasingly popular over recent times. Market sentiment is one of the key pillars underpinning most asset markets, and market sentiment is the ultimate demonstration of crowd behaviour. If that crowd rushes in one direction and the group grows, then (in theory) markets can move. A popular technical indicator termed the Elliot Wave has been used for decades to pinpoint such crowd dynamics. But like many indicators, it lags; it doesn’t lead. It tells you what has happened, not what will happen next, a common fault with most technical indicators. Elliot Wave theory might illustrate one critical fact; are you or will you be on the right side of the market? It can’t tell you when the market suddenly turns because it can’t tell you what percentage of the market is long or short at any snapshot in time. The Admirals sentiment tool Over recent years technical indicators have evolved, and some are hybrids between fundamental and technical analysis. The Admirals’ sentiment widget for forex pairs and gold is an excellent example of this union. We know we must develop fundamental and technical analysis skills to succeed in the FX trading industry, but sometimes we can be guilty of overcomplicating the science. We might duplicate some indicators on our charts and curve fit the past data to match our expectations. But with something as black and white as a sentiment widget, you can’t do this. How the sentiment widget works Admirals and other brokers have their trade execution data screened by a service company called FX Blue Labs, and brokers can even choose to have a live feed delivered to FX Blue. FX Blue then aggregates the data and publishes the sentiment pie-charts in an easy-to-read format. Traders can quickly visually analyse the weight of sentiment in, for example, major currency pairs like EUR/USD and minor pairs such as AUD/JPY. The data only covers the most traded pairs, as information is intermittent and random for the more exotic currency pairs. You can see what the sentiment is relating to a currency pair expressed as a percentage. How to use the sentiment widget Your interpretation skills are needed to analyse the percentage readings as part of your overall trading plan. You’ll need to decide which percentage reading is your action point. It’s clear that a 50-50% balance is the sentiment for a currency pair balanced on a knife-edge, but what about 60-40%? You also must consider how quickly that sentiment has changed. Has the 60-40% distribution been in place for several days, suggesting a currency pair stuck in a range or is it continuing to trend in the current direction? A sentiment widget is a tool best used in conjunction with others; it would be unwise to use it singularly as a standalone sign of a security’s value in the marketplace. However, concentrating on its single purpose could prove incredibly valuable, particularly in a trading strategy based on probability and underpinned by risk. Let’s say you’re a swing trader and use the widget. You have a simple rule; you never take a trade opposite the current dominant sentiment. If traders are long, you don’t go short, and vice-versa. Or you could use the sentiment widget as your final decision-maker. For instance, you use a four technical indicator strategy, and all the indicators align, encouraging you to take the trade. But before you execute the transaction, you take a final look at the sentiment reading to confirm your decision. Another advantage of the sentiment widget is for showing FX correlations. We know that USD/CHF moves in a negatively correlated pattern to EUR/USD most of the time. The sentiment reading might confirm this and indirectly discourage you from taking trades that don’t correlate. For instance, is there any value in being long EUR/USD but short GBP/USD? Is there a downside? Like all widgets and tools, it’s not perfect, and it has limitations. The most critical is that 90% of trading in the FX market is institutional; therefore, the service provider can’t tell you where Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs’ clients have positions. So, you could extend your sentiment reading analysis to include the COT (commitment of traders) report published at the end of each trading week. https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm Most banks and hedge funds declare their market positions, and you can read the sentiment. If the sentiment widget readings aren’t that different from the institutional COT positions, you might regard the sentiment widget as accurate. You also need to set up the time frame of the sentiment widget reading. The COT report is beneficial for position traders, not scalpers or day traders. The COT readings tend to turn like oil tankers, not water-skis. Admirals has a library of analysis you should take a closer look at A click on the analytics section of the Admirals website reveals a comprehensive library of valuable features and widgets, and traders shouldn’t overlook the volume of articles published by their leading analysts. In this section, you’ll find a heat map, podcasts, economic calendar, trading central, and columns concentrating on fundamental and technical analysis. All this multi-layered contribution is there for one specific reason, to encourage traders to better themselves through a dedicated and disciplined approach to market trading.

We’re well into the back half of the year and oil prices remain below $100 per barrel. This seems like such an achievement, given that oil prices unprecedentedly hit negative territory in April last year. With demand hitting rock bottom, producers had no storage available and agreed to actually pay spot buyers to take crude. Following those dark days for the oil market, demand has significantly recovered. While spot prices traded at historical discounts to futures prices in 2020, the situation has flipped. The world’s economy needs oil again and needs it now. Oil’s previous supercycle lasted for a decade, between 2004 and 2014, when a China-led commodity market boom pushed oil to over $100 per barrel. So, are we headed into an oil supercycle? Will suppliers again be struggling to keep up with soaring demand? Most importantly, will oil breach the key $100 market and spike to $200? Drawing on Reserves: A Consumption Recovery Story Demand is what fuels a supercycle. In the 2004-2014 period, Chinese industrialisation drove growth. In 2021, the narrative has changed to countries across the globe emerging from economic contraction – a butterfly shaking off the remnants of its cocoon, to soar. The small roadblock to this narrative is that the cocoon, aka covid-19, seems difficult to shaken off. On the contrary, the virus keeps coming back in mutated forms to pose new challenges and slowing down economic growth Although the Delta variant poses meaningful threat to the promising growth stories in Asia, including China, India, Korea, and Japan, the optimistic narrative holds. In July, the IMF released projections for global growth at 6% for 2021 and 4.9% for 2022, despite stuttering growth in key Asian countries. Drawdowns in oil inventories persisted throughout the first half of 2021 and, while the pace is expected to decelerate in the second half, experts expect the demand for oil to continue rising, supported by the current pace of vaccine rollouts and massive stimulus packages in advanced economies. Against this backdrop, the sentiment for oil remains positive, as can be seen in the Acuity Trading Dashboard. Fill Her Up: A Case for Supply Shortages OPEC+ and the US voluntarily cut oil supply through 2020. Some supply has returned since, but OPEC+ is unlikely to completely phase out production cuts before September 2022. While the EIA expects global production to outpace demand by 2022, this is highly unlikely. For one, there has been no new investment in production since 2014. Also, the uncertainty over demand can prolong supply underinvestment. All That Talk About Going Green How much will rising environmental consciousness impact prices? The pandemic seems to have brought Going Green into everyone’s radar. The transition to green technologies is among the greatest threats to oil, as governments seem determined to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. The Biden administration has proposed a $174 billion investment in the EV market. In the near term, however, this trend towards green could actually benefit oil. Even as EVs gain popularity, setting up their manufacturing facilities and charging stations will rely on existing oil-powered infrastructure, for everything from fabrication to logistics. Growth in EVs will, therefore, likely be a tailwind for oil prices in the short run. The ramping up of the EV market is driving a rally in the overall commodity market, including in metals like silver and palladium. The overly positive sentiment for these metals can be seen on the Acuity Trading Dashboard. Much like the previous decade, China is determined to shape global economic growth in the years ahead. Much of its recovery strategy does not encompass green initiatives. And those that do, are being achieved on the back of its existing oil and coal-powered economy, increasing oil demand. Moreover, as China grows, so will its energy demand. So, even if the mix shifts, the absolute consumption of oil may remain the same or even grow in the near term. The trend of green investing has led investors to shun oil stocks in favour of ESG assets. In 2020, ESG indices outperform their conventional counterparts. Similar trends can be seen in the Fixed Income space, with the green bond market surpassing $1 trillion in 2020. The impact on oil companies is twofold. First, it impacts their access to funding, threatening their ability to turn on supply, conduct explorations and invest in new projects. Secondly, many oil majors are state-owned and were forced to maintain a high dividend or share buyback policy even during the pandemic, reducing the cash flow available for reinvestment. Both these factors pose curtail their ability to ramp up supply. Even in an accelerated green energy transition scenario, McKinsey estimates 23 million barrels of new production will be required to meet demand after 2030. How likely are oil prices to hit $200 per barrel? Much depends on how quickly economies recover from the pandemic and how rapidly they transition to a green economy. The transition is likely to be stickier than policymakers expect, leading to a continued rise in oil consumption at east over the next couple of years."

Indication Investments operates the Libertex Retail FX and CFDs brand, at website libertex.com. Libertex / Indication Investments was fined €160,000 last year by CySEC fine for issues that included not executing certain client orders on terms most favorable to the client, and offering more than the maximum 30x leverage allowed to retail traders. The current alleged violations (see more on that below) are of a more serious nature against Libertex, which remains the Official Trading Partner of EPL team Tottenham Hotspur. Technically, CySEC stated that Indication Investments CIF license number 164/12 is “suspended partially”, as the regulator said it has suspicions of alleged violations of: 1. Article 42 of Regulation (EU) no. 600/2014, as the Company does not appear to comply with paragraphs 4(1)(d) and 4(e) of Directive DI87-09 for the restriction on the marketing, distribution, and sale of CFDs to retail clients. 2. Article 22(1) of the Law, as the Company does not appear to comply at all times with the condition for authorisation provided in article 17(2) of the Law, regarding the organisational requirements. 3. Article 25(1) of the Law, as the Company does not appear to act honestly, fairly and professionally when providing investment services to clients, in accordance with the best interests of the clients. 4. Article 25(3)(a) of the Law, as the Company does not appear to provide information, including marketing communications, to its clients or potential clients that is fair, clear and not misleading. The regulator added that the above decision was reached as the aforementioned alleged violations cause concern and risk relating to the protection of the Company’s clients and/or constitute a threat to the orderly operation and integrity of the market. Regarding the “partial suspension” of the Company’s authorization, CySEC said that involves: i. Prohibition to accept any new client and to enter into any business transaction with them. ii. Prohibition to advertise itself as a provider of investment services. To ensure this the Company is prohibited from marketing/advertising its services to current or potential clients as well as to communicate with them for this purpose, either directly or via third parties with whom the Company cooperates for customer support. iii. For as long as the suspension of the authorisation is in force, the Company is obliged to publish in all its websites an announcement relating to the partial suspension of its authorisation and its inability to provide/carry out investment services/activities to new clients. iv. The Company is not permitted to allow its existing clients to proceed with new deposits unless they explicitly request to do so and at the same time such deposits are made for the sole purpose of covering the margin requirements of the clients’ existing open positions. CySEC said that Indication Investments must take, until the 17th of September 2021, the necessary actions to comply with the aforementioned provisions. For as long as the suspension of the authorisation is in force, the Company, provided this is consistent with the wishes of its existing clients, may proceed with the below actions, without such actions being considered as breach of section 9(7)(a) of DI87-05: (i) Complete all its own transactions and those of its clients which are before it, in accordance with client instructions. (ii) Return all funds and financial instruments which are attributable to its clients."

But this one promises to be interesting. After yesterday the Playtech board issued a Supplementary Circular which reset a shareholder vote for August 18 to approve the planned sale of Playtech’s Financials division to a consortium led by Israeli businessman Zvika Barinboim, competing bidder TT Bond Partners (via Gopher Investments) has issued a strongly worded statement recommending that Playtech shareholders vote against the deal. In its circular, Playtech called the admittedly higher Gopher offer “uncertain”, stating that it had not yet been able to achieve the necessary clarity on Gopher’s ultimate ownership and funding structure, source of funds or ability to obtain the required regulatory clearances. Now, Gopher has issued what seems more like a rebuttal, in the form of a strongly worded press release encouraging Playtech shareholders to vote against the deal come August 18. The Gopher statement (see full text below) said that the firm is “highly disappointed” in Playtech’s board. Gopher gave its own timeline of events, saying that after signing a confidentiality agreement with Playtech, it became reluctant to release information it deemed commercially confidential and sensitive in nature after it was told that Playtech was getting set to issue the Supplementary Circular anyway. Gopher reiterated that its offer is 47% higher than the Barinboim group’s. It also pointed out that it understands that Playtech may have received interest in Finalto from other potential acquiring parties since the date of the adjournment of the originally planned shareholder vote, on July 15. Playtech cancelled that vote to give it time to evaluate the Gopher offer. Ultimately, Gopher’s argument is based on its position as the second largest shareholder in Playtech, believing that Finalto’s attractive growth prospects are not fairly reflected in the value of the Barinboim group’s offer that has been recommended by the Board. However, as Playtech argued yesterday, if the Barinboim offer is rejected there is no guarantee that the Gopher offer will indeed close, or that a better offer might emerge. Like we said above, should be an interesting vote to follow, with more action of some sort before August 18 likely. The full statement released today by Gopher Investments reads as follows: Gopher Response to Statement by Playtech, Related Clarifications and Reasons Why Shareholders Should VOTE AGAINST the Consortium Offer August 03, 2021 Gopher Investments (“Gopher”), a 4.97% shareholder in Playtech plc (“Playtech”), is highly disappointed with the Board of Playtech’s decision not to change its recommendation in relation to the offer from Finalto’s management team backed by a consortium led by Barinboim Group (the “Consortium”). Gopher does not believe the supplementary circular contains a full and fair representation of the interaction between Gopher and Playtech since the previous adjournment of the general meeting and therefore wishes to clarify the following chain of events: Gopher responded promptly to an initial information request from the Board, relating to Gopher’s financing and its high confidence of regulatory approval. The Board sought additional information which was commercially confidential and sensitive in nature. Accordingly, Gopher and Playtech agreed to put a confidentiality agreement in place to allow such information to be shared. On 26 July 2021, having agreed the confidentiality agreement in all material respects, Playtech advised Gopher that it would very shortly be issuing a supplementary circular. The confidentiality process was therefore paused on the understanding that any further information provided would not be taken into consideration ahead of the issuance of the supplementary circular. Since 26 July 2021, Gopher has received: (i) no further request for information from Playtech or its advisers, despite multiple interactions; (ii) no indication that the additional information requested was required for a change of recommendation nor that the Board would not be changing its recommendation; and (iii) no suggestion that Gopher had provided insufficient information for the Board to form a view on its proposal. Shareholders are reminded that Gopher’s proposal: is valued at USD 250 million representing a 47% premium to the base proposal offered by the Consortium; will deliver certainty of full proceeds on completion, with no deferred or contingent component; is on materially comparable contractual terms and expected to complete in a similar timeframe; will be funded by allocated and ring-fenced cash funds available for immediate drawdown; will complete subject to the same conditions as the Consortium’s offer, i.e. subject to shareholder approval and regulatory clearances only; has been subject to significant analysis by Gopher’s legal counsel in each jurisdiction in which Finalto is regulated and accordingly Gopher is highly confident that it will receive regulatory approval in each relevant jurisdiction; and includes a reverse break fee of USD 10 million, illustrating the confidence of Gopher that it will be able to successfully complete the acquisition of Finalto. Additionally, Gopher understands that Playtech may have received interest in Finalto from other potential acquiring parties since the date of the adjournment. As the second largest shareholder in Playtech, with approximately USD 100 million of capital invested, Gopher’s interests are aligned with those of its fellow shareholders in looking to maximise value for Finalto and would expect the Board to properly consider all credible offers. Gopher strongly believes that Finalto’s attractive growth prospects are not fairly reflected in the value of the Consortium’s offer that has been recommended by the Board. For all of these reasons Gopher encourages Playtech shareholders to VOTE AGAINST the Consortium’s offer, in line with the current recommendations of proxy advisors Glass Lewis, ISS and PIRC. Rothschild & Co. is acting as Financial Adviser to Gopher Investments on its Offer for Finalto. White & Case LLP is acting as legal advisor to Gopher Investments on its Offer for Finalto.

Christian Angermayer is new to Retail FX and CFDs, but has had something of a Midas touch in most (but not all) of his business dealings. The serial entrepreneur and billionaire investor from Germany is best known for life sciences and psychedelics (e.g. Atai Life Sciences) and in teaming with leading investment groups and celebrities from around the globe in varied ventures. According to the Australian Financial Review Mr. Angermayer’s investment firm Apeiron has been the lead investor in seven companies that have gone public in 2020-21, raising more than USD $1 billion combined. A number of other companies in his portfolio are reportedly in the queue to IPO in the coming months. And Igor Lychagov certainly does know Retail FX as one of the co-founders of Exness, which has grown to become the largest broker in the industry, with Exness doing nearly $1 trillion of client trading volume monthly. Mr. Lychagov does not have a day-to-day role any more at Exness, but is still involved at the board level. That double vote of confidence, more than what the additional capital can actually do, is what seems to have gotten investors in NAGA excited. We would note that NAGA shares, now at €6.45 after rising Friday by 13.2%, are still well below their 52-week high of €9.30, set back in February after the company posted record trading volumes at NAGA.com to start the year.

After a 20% increase in 2019, Revenues at ThinkMarkets UK were up 13% in 2020, at £4.4 million. Profits, however, were down slightly from last year at £279,000 (2019: £430,000). And all-important client assets were also down, by 13%, totaling £4.7 million as at year-end 2020, versus £5.4 million in 2019. Revenues at entities like ThinkMarkets UK – which just pass on actual execution of trades to a parent company elsewhere, in this case to TF Global Markets (Aust) Pty in Australia – are essentially management fees earned from the executing parent company in return for brokering the trade and holding client assets. But they are generally indicative of overall client activity. ThinkMarkets recently established an institutional services and liquidity arm called – appropriately – Liquidity.net, under its TF Global Markets (UK) Limited FCA license. ThinkForex was established in 2010 by brothers Nauman and Faizan Anees in New Zealand, and relocated its headquarters to Australia upon obtaining ASIC licensing in 2012. ThinkForex rebranded as ThinkMarkets in 2016. The company has dual headquarters in Melbourne and London, where ThinkMarkets set up its FCA-licensed subsidiary TF Global Markets (UK) Limited in 2015. The firm also has a licensed subsidiary in South Africa, established in 2019. ThinkMarkets offers trading on its proprietary ThinkTrader platform, as well as MT4 and MT5."

As FX News Group has reported, the Cyprus Investment Firm (CIF) authorization of Depaho Ltd, the parent company of FXGM, was initially suspended in July 2021. Back then, The regulator explains that there are suspicions of Depaho’s alleged violations of: Article 5(1) of The Investment Services and Activities and Regulated Markets Law of 2017 (‘the Law’) as the Company appears to provide the investment service of investment advice, as a regular occupation, without the granting of prior authorisation by the CySEC.

Article 26(1) of the Law as the Company does not appear to ensure that natural persons giving information about financial instruments, investments or ancillary services, to clients on behalf of the Company, possess the necessary knowledge and competence to fulfil their obligations under articles 25 and 26 of the Law. Article 26(3)(a) of the Law as the Company, when providing investment services other than those referred to in article 26(2), does not appear to ask the client to provide information regarding that person’s knowledge and experience, so as to enable the Company to assess whether the investment service or product envisaged is appropriate for the client. Article 36(10) of the Law as the Company does not appear to have given to the CySEC written notice of the change in the information relevant to its branch in Spain. Article 42 of Regulation (EU) no. 600/2014 as the Company does not appear to comply with paragraphs 4(1)(d) and (5) of Directive DI87-05.

After having its first half 2021 results powered by heady crypto trading volumes, online broker Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) reported somewhat disappointing numbers for Q3-2021. The company’s shares, which had already drifted down by more than 10% since the beginning of September, reacted by losing about 8.5% of their value in Tuesday evening after-market trading Robinhood said that Crypto activity declined from record highs in the prior quarter, leading to considerably fewer new funded accounts, a slight decline in Net Cumulative Funded Accounts, and lower revenue in the third quarter of 2021 ($365 million) compared with the second quarter of 2021 ($565 million) at Robinhood. As far as outlook goes, Robinhood said that its business is affected by many factors, including seasonality, general market conditions (including volatility) and retail trading behavior as well as significant, unanticipated market events. For the three months ending December 31, 2021 (i.e. Q4-2021), Robinhood anticipates that many of the factors that impacted third quarter results, such as seasonal headwinds and lower retail trading activity, may persist. In the absence of any changes to the market environment or exogenous events, the company believes this may result in quarterly revenues no greater than $325 million and full year revenue of less than $1.8 billion. Additionally, Robinhood expects new funded accounts for the fourth quarter will be roughly in line with the 660,000 opened in the third quarter of 2021. In summary, for Q3: Total net revenues increased 35% to $365 million, compared with $270 million in the third quarter of 2020 – but as noted well below Q2’s $565 million. Transaction-based revenues increased 32% to $267 million, compared with $202 million in the third quarter of 2020. Options increased 29% to $164 million, compared with $127 million in the third quarter of 2020. Cryptocurrencies increased 860% to $51 million, compared to $5 million in the third quarter of 2020 – but again, well below the $233 million of Crypto revenue Robinhood saw in Q2. Equities decreased 27% to $50 million, compared with $69 million in the third quarter of 2020. Loss before income tax was $1.37 billion, compared with loss before income tax of $11 million in the third quarter of 2020. Share-based compensation expense totaled $1.24 billion in the third quarter of 2021 of which $1.01 billion was recognized upon our IPO. Net loss was $1.32 billion, or $2.06 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $11 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was negative $84 million, compared with positive $59 million in the third quarter of 2020. Net Cumulative Funded Accounts increased 97% to 22.4 million, compared with 11.4 million in the third quarter of 2020. Monthly Active Users (MAU) increased 76% to 18.9 million, compared with 10.7 million in the third quarter of 2020. Assets Under Custody (AUC) increased 115% to $95 billion, compared with $44 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Average Revenues Per User (ARPU) decreased 36% to $65, compared with $102 in the third quarter of 2020. Vlad Tenev Vlad Tenev, CEO and Co-Founder of Robinhood Markets said: “This quarter was about developing more products and services for our customers, including crypto wallets. More than one million people have joined our crypto wallets waitlist to date. With 24/7 live phone support, we believe that Robinhood is becoming the most trusted and intuitive platform for retail and crypto investors. And looking ahead, we’re committed to delivering tax-advantaged retirement accounts to help everyone invest for the long term.” Robinhood opened the waitlist for crypto wallets, one of its most heavily requested products. More than 1 million customers have signed up to date. Robinhood’s crypto wallets feature is designed to help make crypto more accessible for the average investor, with an intuitive user experience and low-cost, competitive pricing. The feature is being built in public, gathering critical feedback from customers, and employing new multi-factor authentication verification in-app to ensure a secure and reliable experience. Robinhood also launched crypto recurring investments, allowing customers to automatically buy crypto, commission-free, on a schedule of their choice. This product allows customers to build positions in their favorite cryptocurrencies over time while lowering the stress of timing the markets. Robinhood Snacks, a digestible financial news content, is now available from directly within the Robinhood app. The Snacks newsletter is already one of the most widely consumed newsletters in the U.S. with 23.3 million unique readers in Q3. In addition, the Snacks podcast was downloaded 10.8 million times in the quarter. Robinhood also launched Snacks on Snapchat, making Snacks one of the first financially-oriented educational channels to ever be made available on Snapchat’s Discover tab. In the last week, Robinhood started rolling out its Recommendations engine, which helps customers get started by providing new customers who have yet to place their first trade a set of diversified portfolios to choose from. Recently, Robinhood entered the late stages of testing ACATS-In, which will allow customers to transfer their existing investments into Robinhood. The company plans to roll out this feature to customers in the months ahead. As part of Robinhood’s new product roadmap, the company is committed to delivering tax-advantaged accounts for retirement and while there is not a definitive timeline on this product, the company will continue to provide updates on its progress. IPO Access continues to attract issuers and engage customers. To date, Robinhood has partnered with 12 companies that have made their IPOs available to its customers. These companies come from a wide range of industries including consumer, enterprise software, healthcare, and sustainable blockchain. Six of these companies have crossed 30 days since their listing on the platform. In these six IPOs, Robinhood customers held over 80% of their allotted shares 30 days post-IPO, further demonstrating the platform’s ability to connect issuers with a dedicated retail shareholder base. In Q3, seven additional issuers have joined the recently acquired Say Technologies platform to provide individual investors with access to company events like earnings calls, with 18 issuers total using the platform.

How is “financial gaming” different from regular online trading? What is TRADANTS’ target market? What does Lars think about the pushback in the US against the “gamification of trading”? Here is what Lars had to say about these topics and lots more, exclusively at FNG. FNG: Hi Lars, and thanks for joining us today. How did you decide to get involved in financial gaming after your successful experience building JFD as a ‘classic’ Retail FX & CFD broker? Lars: Back in the day, we built JFD with an agency-only business model as an alternative to market-making retail brokers who were in constant conflict of interest with their clients (individual investors). The company elevated the post-trade transparency standard to a new level that eventually made a positive difference for many retail investors worldwide. Nowadays, numerous financial service providers claim to democratise capital markets by reducing or eliminating their commissions or fees. However, the truth is that decreasing or removing participation fees doesn’t mean democratising capital markets. At best, they only lower entry barriers, but you still need a substantial initial investment to get profitable, so capital markets remain exclusive for the wealthier part of society. As a company, TRADANTS aims to solve that global problem and democratise capital markets once and for all by transforming financial trading into a worldwide game where players have an equal chance for success, irrespective of their home country, parents’ wealth or educational background. I had the idea of merging esports, skill gaming, and trading to create a new trading concept for a very long time. Trading is – or at least should be – understood as a strategic skill game, yet mostly missing direct competition. All cultures around the world enjoy playing games that include competing with others, either one on one or via teams, so why should trading remain a ‘lonely’ activity? Instead, I think it has the potential to become an exciting global game played directly against others, including financial education within a gamified approach. TRADANTS will address this gap by turning trading into an epic esport. FNG: Please explain to us, how is “Gamified Trading” different from regular trading, that a client trading on an MT4 or MT5 platform via a Retail FX & CFD broker would be used to? Lars: Firstly, our concept implies that no real fund investment is required to participate in the game, while players get a reasonable chance to earn money from a predefined cash prize pool. Moreover, we apply classic gamification tools to create a fun and engaging environment for our users. Secondly, we will run competitions at a very granular level to serve different types of participants and investment horizons, including single and multiplayer options, blitz tournaments available at any time of the day, as well as long-term earning opportunities. Additionally, we actively promote and enable financial education, as gamification is a great tool to deliver educational content to Gen-Zs. Last but not least, we will enable all participants to get in the spotlight, become famous and receive recognition for their skills among the global trading community. FNG: Who is the target market for financial gaming? Is it largely the existing client base at FX/CFD brokers, or a younger generation which is more into “gaming” in general? Lars: Our target customer segments are Gen-Zs and partly millennials. TRADANTS will deliver solutions that target gamers and esport players as well as traders and poker players within these generations. FNG: There seems to be some pushback (mainly in the US) against the “gamification” of financial trading. The feeling is that gaming is great, but financial trading shouldn’t be turned into a game which takes away from the “serious” approach that people ought to have to investing and trading. How does TRADANTS approach that issue? Lars: We strongly disagree on the ‘serious’ aspect of the topic in different ways. First of all, we don’t think that something serious cannot be turned into a fun and engaging game. Any sport, esport or skill game is a multi-billion dollar industry where players can become superstars, so why should trading be different? Seriousness and gamification are not contradicting per se. Gamification does not mean undermining the complexity of trading but instead gives Gen Zs access to this topic in a fun and engaging environment. On top, our solution is risk-free. FNG: What else can we expect to hear from TRADANTS in the coming months? Lars: We will roll out our first prototype and make it available to the public in December. Our first target markets are several English-speaking African countries (including South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana) and the DACH region, our home market. We aim for a Series A in 2022 and hope to share positive feedback with the media in a few months."

Net new business was £1.3 billion during the period (2020: £0.8bn) driven by higher client numbers, ongoing wealth consolidation on to our platform and flows into Active Savings. The company said this is a pleasing result given the seasonal quieter summer period and the easing of lockdown restrictions. A positive market movement of £1.2 billion, combined with net new business has driven AUA to £138.0 billion as at 30 September 2021. Hargreaves Lansdown welcomed 23,000 net new clients in the period (2020: 31,000), taking active client numbers to 1,667,000. Revenue for the period was £142.2 million, down 1% on last year (2020: £143.7m). Asset based revenues were higher, driven by net inflows and positive market movements as demonstrated by the FTSE All Share, which was up 23% versus the comparative period. However this was more than offset by previous guidance of a drop in interest on client money and a reduction in share dealing revenues. As anticipated share dealing volumes have declined post COVID lockdowns and across the quarter averaged 861,000 deals per month versus 980,000 in the quarter last year and 479,000 the year before. This equates to c40,000 deals per day which is in line with the guidance Hargreaves Lansdown gave for this financial year. Let’s recall that, for the full year ended 30 June 2021 (FY21) Hargreaves Lansdown saw net new business of £8.7 billion (2020: £7.7bn) driven by increased client numbers, continued wealth consolidation onto Hargreaves Lansdown’s platform and strong trading through the COVID-19 period. During the year to 30 June 2021, Hargreaves Lansdown introduced 233,000 net new clients (2020: 188,000 or 170,000 excluding direct book acquisitions) to its services and grew its active client base by 17% to 1,645,000. Total AUA increased by 30% to £135.5 billion as at 30 June 2021 (£104.0bn as at 30 June 2020). This was driven by £8.7 billion of NNB plus positive market movement of £22.8 billion. Revenue for the year was £631.0 million, up 15% (2020: £550.9m), driven by higher average asset levels and record share dealing volumes for the year."

OANDA Europe posted revenues of £29.3 million in 2020, up 148% from £11.8 million in 2019. The company posted net profit of £4.6 million in 2020 after suffering a loss of £3.6 million the previous year. Despite the increase in activity, OANDA Europe saw a drop in client funds held by the firm, to £38.1 million as at 31/12/2020 versus £42.8 million in 2019. After blaming its poor 2019 performance on the then-newly imposed ESMA leverage limits, OANDA said that for 2020 it had in mind five key milestones (i) to return the business to profitability, (ii) increase the size of the active client base, (iii) revamp the product offer, (iv) tightly control the cost base, and (v) ensure the business continues to meet its regulatory and legal obligations. Achieving some of those milestones were aided by the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought with it heightened volatility resulting in a rise in new customers, higher levels of reactivation of dormant clients, and increased trading activity from existing clients leading to a significant increase in trading revenue for the reporting period. For 2021, OANDA said that its key objectives are to continue to deliver profitable earnings whilst maintaining effective risk, expense management and regulatory compliance. This will be achieved by continuing to grow its active client base in the UK, evolving the product offering, and maintaining a tight control on costs. OANDA Europe is an online margin trading business that provides leveraged trading for contracts for difference (CFDs) and spreadbets on foreign currencies, bonds, commodities and indices. This business is conducted primarily through OANDA’s proprietary trading platform FxTrade, a fully automated trading platform which is owned by OANDA Corporation, as well as MetaQuotes’ MT4 platform. The company economically hedges all its exposure with related OANDA entities immediately upon the execution of a client trade to make sure it does not take on any market risk associated with that position. The company currently hedges with OANDA Australia Pty Ltd, and OANDA (Canada) Corporation ULC. OANDA is controlled by private equity investment firm CVC Capital Partners.

Maru, licensed by the South Africa Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), is an asset management company with a dedicated focus on combining disciplined methodologies with insightful qualitative investment processes. It offers equity investment solutions to the institutional investment market. The acquisition, part of KIG BV’s strategy to expand its global reach, gives the Group the right to provide intermediary services for shares, money market instruments, debentures and securitized debt, warrants, certificates, and other instruments. In terms of discretionary services, the acquisition provides KIG BV with a license for bonds, derivative instruments, collective investment schemes, along with long- and short-term deposits in South Africa. The acquisition will give KIG BV access to Africa’s second biggest economy which is continuing to grow and is seen as the engine for growth for the continent. Furthermore, it will add to KIG BV’s presence in the Africa region, as earlier in the year it acquired a license in Mauritius. Gökhan Erkıralp, KIG BV CEO, says: ‘We are very excited about expanding our global presence to South Africa. The country’s fast-growing population and local market presence represent an important opportunity for us. South Africa is also the major financial centre for the African continent, which will provide potential access to an increased customer base.’ ‘KIG BV aims to build a stronger, more innovative, and inclusive approach to international financial markets. We have already stepped into Africa with the GK Trade International in Mauritius and today’s acquisition builds on that. Our group will continue its expansion to increase its global reach and products.’ Global Kapital Group, which operates the GKFX and GKPro FX brokerage brands, has made four acquisitions via KIG BV this year to increase its global reach and products. The Group entered the US with GK Trade New York by acquiring a FINRA licensed broker-dealer, the Australian market with ASIC licensed FairMarkets, the Mauritian market with FSC licensed GK Trade International, and the Turkish market by the takeover of Işık Menkul, a CMB regulated multi-asset broker."

Police asked for the remand of Grinberg and Hananya to be extended, following a police raid late Tuesday that included the aforementioned arrests as well as the seizure of computers, storage devices, and other company documents from the Tel Aviv offices where the purported scam operated. The police’s anti-fraud unit is combing through the seized material, to add evidence to its case against those arrested. While little is known about Hananya, the 47-year old Guy Grinberg is a better known personality in the Israeli high tech scene after acting as VP Business Development from 2006-2009 at Koolanoo, an Israeli-Chinese startup which attracted tens of millions of dollars in venture capital in attempting to build a social media network in China. Lately, Mr. Grinberg’s LinkedIn profile shows him since 2015 as VP Business Development of an unnamed “forex” business. His latest social media posts read “Looking for live crypto cfd leads!!!”, and “Looking for fx retention expert !!! #fxbroker #sales”. Israeli Hebrew language media described more about the alleged scams, whereby the Israel based operation targeted retail traders in the US and several other countries worldwide. The targets were usually initially offered small investments in cryptocurrencies and forex instruments, with the traders often “winning” modest profits. Those small profits built initial trust with clients and were then used as a hook to get the traders to deposit much larger amounts, as large as several hundred thousand dollars, which eventually disappeared. TV news sources in Israel have reported that most of those arrested are sales and retention employees, who have all claimed to have no knowledge of any supposed fraud. They are claiming to have been offered high-paying positions to legally deal with clients who want to trade forex and crypto. We will continue to follow this story as it develops."

Let’s recall that, according to the plaintiffs, this case is about individual investors who invested their money in the stock market and were stripped of their rights to control their own investments. The traders accuse the defendants and other market players of hatching an anticompetitive scheme to restrict Retail Investors’ access to the stock market and prevent the market from operating freely and fairly. According to the traders, the defendants did so to protect each other, and to stop the hemorrhaging losses incurred by the Market Maker Defendants as a result of their accumulation of large short positions. On October 5, 2021, the defendants in the antitrust tranche: Citadel Securities, LLC, Apex Clearing Corporation, ETrade Financial Holdings, LLC, ETrade Securities LLC, Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc., Interactive Brokers, LLC, PEAK6 Investments LLC, Robinhood Financial LLC, Robinhood Markets, Inc., Robinhood Securities, LLC, filed a reply to the Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint (CCAC). The document, seen by FX News Group, also serves as support to defendants’ motion to dismiss. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have utterly failed to plead a cognizable antitrust claim that can survive a motion to dismiss. According to the defendants, what is missing from the complaint are, inter alia, sufficient factual allegations of any agreement between any Defendants (let alone among all of them) to restrict trading in any security; any attempt to identify any benefit that any of the brokers (self-clearing or otherwise) received from allegedly restricting trading to help Citadel Securities; or any plausible explanation for how a conspiracy arose that resulted in the members imposing disparate restrictions on disparate sets of stocks, while at the same time other brokers not alleged to be part of the conspiracy and/or now voluntarily dismissed from the case took similar steps. According to the defendants, the facts alleged in the CCAC give rise to only one plausible explanation: “in the face of unprecedented market volatility spurred on by internet speculation, various brokers, including non-Defendants, acted independently to protect the integrity of the marketplace and their customers ability to trade broadly in securities by implementing a variety of temporary trading restrictions that differed in duration and scope, tailored to each of their circumstances”. The defendants note that it is clear that the communications cited by the plaintiffs do not evidence any agreement at all, let alone the anticompetitive agreement Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer. The communications between Robinhood and Citadel Securities (and among Robinhood employees about Citadel Securities) do not contain or indicate any agreement to restrict trading in any security, the defendants say. The defendants add that the complaint is devoid of any allegation of any communications (let alone any agreement) between: (1) Citadel Securities and Apex, (2) Citadel Securities and Interactive Brokers, (3) Citadel Securities and any (now dismissed) Introducing Broker Defendants, (4) Robinhood and E*TRADE, (5) Robinhood and Interactive Brokers, (6) Robinhood and any (now dismissed) Introducing Broker Defendants, (7) Apex and E*TRADE, (8) Apex and Interactive Brokers, (9) E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers, (10) E*TRADE and any (now dismissed) Introducing Broker Defendants, and (11) Interactive Brokers and any (now dismissed) Introducing Broker Defendants. In short, the defendants say that the cited communications show only that some defendants have pre-existing business relationships. The fact that they would communicate during the relevant time is not only unremarkable, it is in fact fully expected, the defendants explain. For example, the plaintiffs are said to offer no explanation for why it is plausible to infer a conspiracy among the defendants when other brokerages not alleged to be part of any conspiracy employed similar tactics to prevent Retail Investors from opening positions in at least one or more of the Relevant Securities. These brokerages included TD Ameritrade (restrictions on GME and AMC) and Charles Schwab (restrictions on GME, AMC and EXPR), neither of which Plaintiffs allege conspired with anyone. They also included Cash App Investing LLC, eToro USA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Bank PLC, which Plaintiffs similarly do not allege were part of any conspiracy. The fact that parties not alleged to be members of the conspiracy acted similarly as alleged conspirators indicates that the restrictions arose from permissible business reasons, not anticompetitive ones. The defendants argue that an alternative explanation for why each broker defendant (and non- defendant) enacted trading restrictions in late January 2021 is the extraordinary market volatility. This was the common stimulus] to which Defendants had independent responses. According to the defendants, the market volatility spurred the NSCC to issue outsized collateral calls on many brokers, including some broker defendants, which, in turn, required them to take individual measures to reduce their firms risk exposure. Still others were compelled by the volatility to implement their own restrictions, even absent outsized collateral calls. Further, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs fail to articulate a plausible common motive for the defendants to engage in the alleged conspiracy. The common motive that the plaintiffs assert is that the defendants had a collective interest in maintaining their mutually beneficial business relationships based on lucrative payment for order flow relationships with Citadel Securities. The defendants say that this argument fails. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs do not allege adequately that Citadel Securities actually held a short position in the Relevant Securities. In fact, Plaintiffs admit it is generally impossible to ascertain which investors have a short position in a particular security at any point in time. Furthermore, according to the defendants, the plaintiffs do not allege that Citadel Securities threatened to (or even suggested that it would) cut off business relationships with any broker defendant, or that it would retaliate against any defendant if those brokers did not agree to protect Citadel Securities alleged short position in the Relevant Securities. Also, the defendants stress that the plaintiffs do not address the fact that Citadel Securities is not the only market maker. If it had cut off PFOF, there are other entities from which brokers direct order flow and receive such payments. In addition, the defendants note that the plaintiffs do not allege that Citadel Securities stopped accepting buy orders for the Relevant Securities from any brokers at any time. The defendants also note the plaintiffs’ repeat that government investigations are indicative of anticompetitive collusion. But simply pleading the existence of government inquiries is insufficient to raise an inference of conspiracy. Indeed, the plaintiffs later claim: there is no evidence that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating or plans to investigate the defendants collusive behavior. The defendants conclude that even with the benefit of documentary evidence ordinarily unavailable at the pleading stage, the plaintiffs still fail to adequately plead a claim. According to the defendants, the CCAC should be dismissed with prejudice."

Maxiflex operates the EuropeFX.com retail FX brokerage brand, as well as europecapitalgroup.com and europestocks.com. The regulator said that there are suspicions of alleged violations of rules at Maxiflex including those relating to conducting business and/or to facilitating the conducting of business not stated in its authorisation, and the company does not appear to comply at all times with the authorisation conditions relating to suitability of members of the management body, suitability of shareholder, and organisational requirements. The suspension comes after Maxiflex settled with CySEC late last year and paid a fine of €370,000 for what were called “possible violations” by Maxiflex regarding organisational requirements with which a CIF (i.e. a licensed CySEC entity) is required to comply, conflicts of interest, information to clients, the assessment of suitability and appropriateness and reporting to clients, and the obligation to execute orders on terms most favourable to the client. CySEC noted that within one month, Maxiflex must take the necessary actions to comply with the aforementioned provisions. For as long as the suspension of its license is in force, Maxiflex / EuropeFX is not permitted to provide/carry out investment services/activities, to enter into any business transaction with any person and accept any new client, or to advertise itself as a provider of investment services. The company, provided this is consistent with the wishes of its existing clients, may complete all its own transactions and those of its clients which are before it, in accordance with client instructions, and may return all funds and financial instruments which are attributable to its clients."

The Department of Enforcement alleges that, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020, Spartan Capital Securities, LLC failed to file, or to timely file, 223 amendments to the Uniform Applications for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Forms U4) and Uniform Termination Notices for Securities Industry Registration (Forms U5) for 72 of its registered representatives. As a result, Spartan failed to disclose, or to timely disclose, hundreds of reportable events involving its representatives, including customer arbitrations, customer complaints, bankruptcies, and unsatisfied liens and judgments. Due to these disclosure failures, Spartan is said to have violated Article V, Sections 2(c) and 3(b) of FINRA’s By-Laws and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010. Among its disclosure failures, Spartan failed to amend, or to timely amend, the Forms U4 and Forms U5 of its executive officers and a branch manager to disclose customer arbitrations against those registered representatives, including primarily the Forms U4 of the firm’s two most senior executives: John D. Lowry, Spartan’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Kim M. Monchik, Spartan’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). Lowry and Monchik were personally responsible for ensuring that the information on their own Forms U4 was current, accurate, and complete. Lowry and Monchik, however, each failed to amend, or to timely amend, their Forms U4 to disclose arbitration filings and resolutions thereof on 38 and 15 occasions, respectively. As a result, Lowry and Monchik each violated Article V, Section 2(c) of FINRA’s By-Laws and FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010. Spartan’s failure to amend, or to timely amend, the Forms U4 and Forms U5 of its executive officers and a branch manager was willful, as were Lowry’s and Monchik’s failures to amend, or to timely amend, their own Forms U4. Respondents’ willfulness is demonstrated by, among other things, their continuing refusal to disclose arbitrations despite warnings from FINRA in 2017 and 2018 that they were required to do so. The Department of Enforcement respectfully requests that the Panel make findings of fact and conclusions of law that Respondents committed the violations and order that one or more of the sanctions provided under FINRA Rule 8310(a), including monetary sanctions, be imposed."

In the meantime, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey has issued the following press release on the recent market developments: “The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey implements floating exchange rate regime and has no commitment to any exchange rate level. Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand conditions according to free market dynamics. Under certain conditions, the Central Bank may only intervene in excessive volatility without aiming any permanent direction. In FX markets, unhealthy price formations are being observed that are unrealistic and completely detached from economic fundamentals. The CBRT deemed it necessary to warn our companies and citizens against possible losses by trading at values completely detached from economic fundamentals under extremely volatile market conditions”."

Put otherwise, many of the defendants cannot be found. On November 5, 2021, the plaintiffs in this action filed a motion for alternative service on a number of defendants. The document, seen by FX News Group, proposes the authorizing of alternative service of process of the summon and complaint on the foreign defendants in this action by: (i) email; (ii) internet direct messaging and social media (i.e., Facebook or LinkedIn); (iii) publication; or (iv) International Mail, return receipt requested, and service will be deemed complete upon delivery of summons and complaint by any of the foregoing methods. Let’s recall that the plaintiffs allege that the defendants fraudulently marketed, advertised and represented that ROFX.netwas an electronic trading platform designed to make investments for Plaintiffs’ benefit in order to solicit investors to deposit fiat money or cryptocurrency. In reality, ROFX distributed little of its purported trading profit, prevented investors from making withdrawals, and stole their investment capital (including investments made via cryptocurrency), to perpetuate a massive fraud that was global in scope. To date, the plaintiffs have successfully executed service on eight defendants, including Auro Advantages LLC, Global E-Advantages LLC, Grovee LLC, EasyCom LC, Notus LLC, Shopostar LLC, Anna Shymko, and Stanislav Khomenko (who is now dismissed from this action). However, Plaintiffs’ attempts to serve Defendants ROFX.net, Nataliya Los, Borys Konalavenko, and Aware Choice Ltd., within the United States at their last known addresses were unsuccessful as the addresses for these individuals and entities are fake. Defendants used fake addresses on company records and reside across more than ten countries. As a result, tracking them down and attempting to serve has been costly and difficult. As a result, Plaintiffs seek authorization for alternative service on the following 22 defendants who have not been formally served: Jorge Luis Castillo (Belize), Peter Mogilniy (UK or Hong Kong), Wealthy Developments LP (Scotland, UK), Anton Bilous (Scotland, UK), VDD- Trading Ltd. (UK), Dmytro Fokin (UK), Manuchar Daraselia (UK), Epayments Systems Ltd. (UK), Andre Fetin (UK), Mikhail Rymanov (England or UK), Brass Marker s.r.o (Czech Republic), IT Outsourcing Co. Ltd. (Thailand), Nattpemol Krinara (Thailand), PapharaTsor Nrivratporn (Thailand), Boonruk Ruamkit Co. Ltd. (Thailand), Youras Ziankoviach (in custody), Ester Holdings Inc. (Cyprus), Igoria Trade S.A. (Poland). The defendants went to great lengths to avoid identification. ROFX is an unincorporated entity providing unregulated financial services through its web-based platform to investors around the world, with registered addresses at 1200 Brickell Ave. Suite 1500, Miami, FL 33131, USA; Tower 42, 265 Old Broad Street London, United Kingdom, ECN 1HN; and Hong Kong Trade Centre, 161-167 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong, China. Plaintiffs attempted to serve ROFX at its Miami address; however, efforts proved unsuccessful because no ROFX office ever existed there. Defendants also hid behind shell companies. Specifically, deposits for the ROFX investor accounts (in USD or EUR) were wired from Plaintiffs’ personal bank accounts to shell companies. ROFX used email to communicate with its customers. It used investor emails to advertise its new trading algorithm and keep investors up to date on the platform’s regulatory issues. The trading platform had a live chat function on the site used to field questions and a Facebook page to solicit investment.ROFX used these channels to promote its products, push updates, and advertise its initial coin offering. ROFX also had multiple phone numbers in the United States, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. It advertised with online media outlets such as Facebook, Google, and Yahoo Finance, and consumer review websites such as Trustpilot ̶ often flooding these sites with positive reviews. ROFX also accepted investor deposits in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is a sophisticated internet based currency. The plaintiffs argue that, given the Defendants operated an Internet-based trading platform, are savvy enough to transact in digital-internet based cryptocurrencies, and communicated with their investors exclusively through electronic and telephonic communications – alternate service in the form of e-mail, social media, web postings, and alternatively, publication, will adequately provide Defendants with reasonable notice of this action. In fact, this is the most effective and expeditious method of service to notify the Defendants of the pending action given their concealed identities and residences all over the world."

Effectively, we understand that the “ETX Capital” brand – one of the longest standing and known brands in the UK online trading scene – will be phased out in the coming months, and merged with Oval. Following a recent transition period, Oval said that it continues on its mission to make finance more consumer-friendly, now with an expanded team and powerful new technologies. Oval said that it is completing the integration with ETX Capital, and restated its ambitious plans for the future. The past few months have allowed the two companies to combine into one solid business ready to face future challenges, with a team of more than 180 people across three offices in Italy, the United Kingdom and Cyprus. This renewed financial stability and injection of diverse industry experience will allow the company to grow with confidence, while offering Oval users more ways to invest and trade on global market opportunities. The brands will become one: Oval, uniting smart, intuitive and accessible finance with ETX Capital’s expertise and long legacy in the financial markets. With this combined industry knowledge, Oval will focus on technological innovation to further support its consumer-first approach. Claudio Bedino Claudio Bedino, CMO of Oval (who has also taken over as CMO of ETX Capital following the recent departure of Nandik Barbhaiya) explained: “New features will be announced over the next few months, but Oval’s vision and the values it has carried over the years will not change. The company’s business – the product – will always be aimed at helping you build good financial habits through savings and investments using modern technologies. All of this will be accompanied by a renewed trading offering that is consistent with the smart qualities associated with our brand.” Oval added that it will benefit from ETX Capital’s extensive experience in financial markets and will offer new services that are increasingly effective and personalised to customers’ savings and investment needs. The fintech company said it will soon implement new features for those who want to explore the world of investments. At the moment, Oval is strengthening its team to support growing ambitions, and is actively looking to recruit talented people keen to define the fintech revolution and help the brand shift from a start-up to a substantial industry presence. ETX Capital operator Monecor (London) Limited was acquired by Swiss fintech investor Guru Capital SA in 2020."

The move emphasizes the breadth of Vantage’s platform which offers CFDs on Forex, Indices, Shares, Commodities, and Cryptocurrencies – signaling the multi-asset offerings of the platform beyond Forex. The company said that the rebrand is a key component of Vantage’s ongoing global expansion strategy to deliver unparalleled experience on multi-asset products and provide the tools for both established and emerging markets to ensure better execution on trades. In order to facilitate this, Vantage has invested in significant upgrades to its technology including improvements to its app such as enhanced interface, access to daily market analysis and localised payment solutions particularly beneficial to users in emerging markets. The rebrand comes at a time when the trading landscape is seeing a monumental shift worldwide. Following the pandemic, thousands of young and ambitious traders are entering the space and since 2020 Vantage has seen a 68% increase in platform users. An increasing number of these are from emerging markets which are not traditionally prioritised by the existing retail landscape, something Vantage seeks to remedy. Marc Despallieres, Chief Strategy Officer said: “Today’s announcement is the realisation of more than a decade of establishing a platform that puts customers at the centre of our offering. Dropping the FX from our name is an important development in demonstrating our capabilities beyond foreign exchange, but this rebrand is so much more. “At Vantage we are passionate about offering a service that connects customers to the best tools, resources, and support regardless of trading ability and geographic location. For too long retail trading platforms have failed to prioritise localised needs, particularly in emerging markets, now we want to address those shortfalls and level the playing field for a new generation of traders.” The rebrand announcement follows a number of global strategic hires by Vantage in recent months including APAC’s Regional Strategy Director Eoh You Loong and Global Marketing Director Geraldine Goh. Created in 2009, Vantage is a global, multi-asset broker that empowers people to build their own success and seize the best market opportunities. Headquartered in Sydney, Australia, Vantage has built a reputation across APAC for delivering a higher standard of trading for clients of all sizes. Now, with over 1000 staff, 30 offices and an average trading volume of $200bn (US) per month, an ambitious global growth strategy will deliver a higher standard of trading to all markets, particularly those that are traditionally underserved, with less developed financial services. Customer trust is paramount, and Vantage takes a robust approach to compliance in all the markets they operate. Clients have access to one of the most powerful and nimble platforms, allowing them to trade as efficiently and smoothly as possible across CFDs on Forex, indices, shares, commodities, and crypto currencies. Vantage is more than just a platform. It’s a human-centric service and community that seamlessly connects customers to the right tools, resources, and support at all levels – whether professional or retail – to ensure trading is both simple and fast."

Usually dominated by traditional banks and online brokers, stock market investments by retail investors are increasingly being made via neo-brokers. This study covers 218 million transactions executed between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2021 by French and foreign retail investors on financial instruments for which the AMF is the competent authority of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity. While the number of active investors per quarter stagnated around one million until the third quarter of 2019, a first large intake of new investors is noted in the fourth quarter of 2019, related to the initial public offering of Française des Jeux. Since the health crisis, equally large intakes of new retail investors then increased the overall number of retail investors active in the markets, in a context marked by lockdowns and increased teleworking. This affinity for financial markets remained uninterrupted by the resumption of work with physical presence in a period of higher financial market volatility, because the number of active retail investors has doubled since 2020 and has remained at high levels (more than 2.5 million). Moreover, the growth in the number of incumbent and new investors, compared with growth in the number of transactions for these categories of investors, shows that the new investors perform proportionally fewer transactions than incumbent investors. Equity transactions account for 75% of the total number of transactions. This figure reaches 85.5% if transactions in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are included. All the instruments classified as “non-complex” in this study (equities and share rights, ETFs and bonds) account for 87.5% of the transactions performed by retail investors. However, it is interesting to note that the ETFs most often traded by retail investors are those offering an index leverage effect, which is a sign of retail investors’ use of higher-risk products. In contrast, only a small number of transactions are performed on bonds and other debt products. The remaining 12.5% of transactions are mostly transactions on equity derivatives, with a majority of Contracts For Difference (CFDs) and warrants. Between the third quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2021, each category of institution’s active client base increased from 712,600 active clients to more than 1,200,000 clients for traditional banks (+68%), from 214,600 active clients to more than 520,500 clients for online banks (+142%), and from 68,000 active clients to more than 409,400 clients for neo-brokers (+502%). However, it should be noted that the sharp increase in traditional bank’s clients in the fourth quarter of 2019 can be explained mainly by the initial public offering of Française des Jeux, which attracted a large number of new investors exclusively via traditional banks and online banks, since participation in this IPO was not offered to clients by neo-brokers. The population of active investors has become significantly younger since the third quarter of 2018 regardless of the category of institution considered. The fall in the average age of the broad population of active investors is even more pronounced due to the increase over time in the number of neo-broker clients, who have always been significantly younger than the clients of the other categories of institutions, with an average age of 36.8 years at present."

On 27 May 2021, the boards of EQ and Bidco announced they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of EQ. It is intended that the acquisition will be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006. As set out in the Scheme Document, the acquisition was conditional, inter alia, on the approval of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to the acquisition of control over certain of EQ’s subsidiaries which will arise from the successful completion of the acquisition. EQ and Bidco today announce that approval from the FCA has now been received and this condition has therefore been satisfied.

OFX, formerly known as Oz Forex, saw its shares rise by 15% after announcing the deal, closing Monday at A$2.15, a new 52-week high for the company. OFX has a market cap of A$522m. Based in Edmonton, Canada and founded in 1998 by Edmonton mayoral candidate Michael Oshry (who placed fourth in the October 18 vote), Firma is a global foreign exchange service provider servicing Corporate clients. As at 30 September 2021, Firma had 194 employees, over 9,600 Corporate customers and operates from 9 offices in Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand. Firma is a profitable business, with A$51.9m in FY21 Revenue and A$10.9m in FY21 EBITDA. 95% of the company’s clients are Corporate clients, with Spot FX transactions accounting for 88% of activity (Forwards 10%, Other 2%). Firma’s key products include spot and market orders, multi-currency accounts, payments and mass payments and forward contracts. The company has strong commercial expertise and will significantly add to OFX’s volumes in major currency pairs such as USD/CAD and USD/GBP, diversifying its currency flows as well as the industries its Corporate segment currently serves. The acquisition delivers incremental revenue to OFX’s Corporate segment of 93% and to its North America region of 121%, representing more than five years of organic growth. With combined LTM to September 21 pro-forma Group revenue of A$186.5m and EBITDA of A$55.1m, OFX will be a major specialist Corporate cross border payments provider in Canada. OFX Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Skander Malcolm said: “This is our first major acquisition and very much aligned with our strategy of building scale in the Corporate segment and growing the North American region. Firma generates strong earnings from a high- quality customer base and has an excellent service culture, so there is a lot of alignment with OFX. By bringing our businesses together we become a much bigger Corporate specialist with a strong recurring revenue base and considerable growth opportunities.” The total consideration represents 9.0x Firma’s LTM EBITDA to 30 September 2021. The Acquisition is expected to generate underlying EPS accretion of approx. >20% in year one and >30% in year two following completion. OFX expects to deliver at least $5m of pre-tax cost and revenue synergies in FY25 through leveraging its global technology platform, larger footprint of licenses and enhanced product offering, and from benefits of scale such as lower banking fees. The acquisition will be funded by an underwritten debt facility and existing cash. At completion, OFX expects net debt to pro-forma EBITDA of approximately 1.5x. Given the strong cash flow profile of the combined entity, OFX expects to repay its debt in less than four years, subject to no other value-accretive growth opportunities emerging which require funding. The Board considers it prudent to put the share buy-back program on hold to prioritise repayment of debt. Mr Malcolm concluded: “Our business is continuing to perform well, with the positive trends we drove in the first half continuing into the third quarter. With the addition of Firma we can accelerate that growth by combining our infrastructure and risk culture with their customer base and service excellence, delivering further profitable growth and value accretion for OFX shareholders.” The acquisition is expected to complete in first quarter of FY23 subject to customary conditions. Goldman Sachs is acting as financial advisor on the acquisition. Stikeman Elliot is acting as legal advisor on the acquisition. Founded in 1998, OFX is an international money services provider based in Sydney with eight offices across the world and more than 400 staff. It offers money transfers and foreign exchange services for consumer and business clients across 50+ currencies. Through its “digital + human” business model, OFX provides 24/7 client support to complement its global digital platform."

The police and regulator action included the arrest of three Samtrade FX management team members, which we believe includes the company’s controlling shareholder and CEO, Sam Goh. The FAQ statement (see full text below) does not really provide much of an update, other than confirming our earlier report that the company is not able to either complete client trades, nor honor client withdrawal requests at this stage. It also did not make any mention or provide an update on the arrests of its management team group. At the time of the arrests and shutdown, the regulator said that Samtrade FX and its related entities are currently being investigated for carrying on a business in any regulated activity, while based in Singapore, without a capital markets services license. The regulator added that there is reason to suspect that irregular trading activities have been carried out on the platform, and investigations are being carried out on these activities. The full text of the Samtrade FX “FAQ” statement follows: FAQ IN RELATION TO MEDIA RELEASE DATED 3 JANUARY 2022 BY COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AND MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE This FAQ is intended to answer questions arising from our recent corporate statement in relation to the media release dated 3 January 2022 by the CAD and MAS of Singapore. If you have not done so, please read it here. Q1: Where is the status of customers / investors’ deposits now? A1: The management and the officers of the companies cannot access the relevant account(s) where the customers / investors’ deposits currently reside. CAD has also issued prohibition orders against the companies’ management from accessing such accounts. The companies and its officers are seeking legal advice to consider options related to gaining access to the clients’ deposits to meet any withdrawal request by customers / investors based on contractual obligations on a best-efforts basis.

There are now two ways for displaying trading sessions for the futures contracts and continuous futures from CME Group: Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) is the main full session for the instrument, according to its specification; Regular Trading Hours (RTH) is a reduced session that displays data between 08:30-15:15 CT. You can search for new high/low prices, use the Session Volume Profile, and carry out any technical analysis that was previously hindered by bars outside the RTH session. The feature is available to all users regardless of their plan and subscriptions. The feature affects the data only in intraday timeframes, the data inside the daily candle is the same for ETH and RTH. It is supported by futures and continuous only from COMEX, CME, NYMEX, CBOT exchanges. If you need daily candles with RTH data, try using 24h candles instead of daily. The TradingView platform is regularly updated. In December 2021, for instance, TradingView introduced a new tool – Idea. The new tool, like a tweet, lets you add ideas that interest you right onto the chart, so that they are always at hand. There are two ways to add an idea to a chart: Select the “Idea” tool in the left panel, then paste the link to the idea in the window that opens. Copy the idea link and paste it into the TradingView chart using “Ctrl + V” on Windows or “⌘V” on Mac. Or just click “Paste” in the context menu of the chart."

The SFC’s investigation found that ZIFC, which permitted 26 clients to use their designated customer supplied systems (CSSs) for placing orders during the material time, had failed to conduct adequate due diligence on the CSSs. As such, ZIFC was not in a position to properly assess and manage the money laundering and terrorist financing and other risks associated with the use of such CSSs by its clients before allowing them to be connected to its broker supplied system (BSS). In addition, ZIFC had failed to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for clients to login to their internet trading accounts via CSSs for six months until October 2018. The SFC identified that eight clients have authorized multiple third parties to place orders for their accounts via CSSs. However, ZIFC had failed to take reasonable steps to establish the true and full identity of these clients and their ultimate beneficial owners, nor make proper enquiries before approving the clients’ requests to set up the third party operated accounts. The regulator further found that failure to have in place an effective monitoring system resulted in ZIFC’s failure to detect unusual money movements in three client accounts between January and August 2018 and 1,052 instances of self-matched trades in two client accounts between March and May 2018. The SFC concluded that ZIFC’s conduct was in breach of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML Guideline), the Guidelines for Reducing and Mitigating Hacking Risks Associated with Internet Trading and the Code of Conduct. In deciding the disciplinary sanctions against ZIFC, the SFC took into account a variety of factors, including the necessity of a strong deterrent message that such failures are not acceptable, as well as ZIFC’s cooperation with the SFC."

The new money makes it €15 million in capital raised by Skilling over the past 18 months. Skilling raised the new funds from what it called “seasoned Scandinavian investors,” without providing any specific names (more on the company’s background and funding sources follows below). The company added that latest financing was done at a valuation premium of “nearly 50%” to its valuation a year ago. Skilling said that the financing was done on the back of what it termed a record year, with triple-digit yearly increases in active users, trade volumes and revenues, although again the company didn’t provide any specific figures to back that up. Skilling CEO Michael Kamerman commented, “This fundraising round represents the beginning of the next phase of Skilling’s growth as we further assert ourselves in the fintech industry. We are pleased to have several forward-looking investors from various countries committed to contributing to Skilling’s long-term growth.” Skilling said that it will deploy its fresh capital to accelerate the recruiting of top talent and further advance its proprietary trading tech to remain adaptive in the ever-changing world of investing and online trading. Along these lines, we exclusively reported back in November that the company was hiring former OANDA UK CEO David Hodge, who will be joining Skilling in Q1 (following mandatory garden leave post-OANDA) as Skilling’s new CMO. The company’s vision is to offer simple but robust technology that allows customers to navigate their trading and investments throughout the customer’s financial life. This long-term vision with investments in a deep proprietary tech stack supported by some of the industry’s brightest talent will accelerate Skilling’s position within its current industry and beyond. The capital raise comes after what management calls an exciting year for Skilling, as the company launched a number of products and services such as its introducing broker and affiliate program with a bespoke partnership portal adding functionality and transparency for partners, as well as the launch of the Skilling Copy platform, where customers can copy or follow thousands of trading strategies provided by other traders. In 2021, Skilling said it was one of the first brokers to offer trending products in light of the “meme trading” culture that captivated traders and the public throughout the year. Skilling is somewhat of an interesting upstart in the Retail FX world. The broker was founded about 10 years ago by former Scandinavian partners in a company called Optimizer Invest – Henrik Persson Ekdahl, Mikael Harstad and Andre Lavold. The three hired former Google Sweden country director Anders Berglund as CEO in 2016, and Skilling formally launched as a CySEC-licensed entity in 2019. Mr. Berglund left around launch time, at which point Andre Lavold took over CEO duties, handing them over to former FXCM UK senior executive Michael Kamerman who joined Skilling about a year and a half ago. Skilling is now managed from several locations including the southern Spanish resort town of Marbella where Mr. Kamerman is based, Cyprus, and London, where Mr. Hodge will head operations. It has been increasingly focused on “new age” products such as crypto trading and NFTs, recently adding trading in Fan Tokens."

The funding round was co-led by D1 Capital Partners and Spark Capital, with participation from General Atlantic, Index Ventures, Mammoth, CapitalG (Alphabet’s independent growth fund), Altimeter, Iconiq Strategic Partners, Canapi Ventures, and Parafi Growth Fund. Adding to the support of existing investors such as Sequoia Capital, Coatue, Ribbit, Bank of New York Mellon, Paradigm, DRW Venture Capital, Tenaya Capital and SCB10x, Fireblocks has become the highest valued digital asset infrastructure provider to date. With $2 trillion in digital assets transferred, the Fireblocks’ platform now supports more than 20 blockchains and 1,000 cryptocurrencies, and is powering digital asset use cases across trading, gaming, NFTs, digital securities, and payments that will allow more businesses, web 2.0 leaders and enterprises, including all financial institutions, to participate in the digital asset economy. The disruption of cryptocurrencies in the financial sector reached the point of no-return and over the next decade every business will become a web 3 business. According to a recent Gartner report, one-fifth of major organizations will utilize digital currencies by 2024, indicating that the adoption of crypto by large corporations will accelerate in 2022 and beyond. In the last year alone, consumers and companies alike have become increasingly interested in innovative payment alternatives, such as Airbnb, Microsoft and AT&T. In fact, Visa’s new survey revealed that 25% of small businesses in nine countries plan to accept crypto payments in 2022. In the last year, Fireblocks grew at an exponential pace from 150 to over 800 customers around the world, with institutions in the Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions leading the way. The Fireblocks Network, which connects members to the crypto capital markets ecosystem and enables instant settlements, is used by customers such as Bank of New York Mellon, Revolut, Galaxy Digital, Crypto.com, BlockFi, Deribit, eToro, CoinShares, SwissBorg, 3AC, B2C2 and more. To date, Fireblocks customers have amassed $45 billion assets under custody on the platform. Additionally, with the launch of Aave Arc, Fireblocks has become the first to enable decentralized finance for institutional players. Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said: “The adoption of cryptocurrencies across the financial and commercial sectors is going to accelerate in 2022, and Fireblocks’ mission is to be a strategic partner for these new market entrants. We are thrilled to be joined by the top growth investors. The new round of financing will accelerate our ability to support our clients globally, as well as heavily invest in innovation for DeFi, NFTs and payments, and allow new and established financial institutions to employ direct custody rather than relying on third parties, which will increase their competitive advantage.” As the pioneer of MPC technology for digital assets, Fireblocks has established a secure multi-layer infrastructure that is at the heart of its platform. Along with these advancements, every business now has the capacity to accept digital assets and cryptocurrencies securely and conveniently, paving the way for all enterprises to become crypto businesses. “Fireblocks has become a key driver of crypto market growth around the world, with an estimated 15% of daily crypto transaction volume secured through their infrastructure,” said Dan Sundheim, founder of D1, a New York based investment firm. “This new injection of capital will further enable Fireblocks to onboard the next wave of businesses into the digital asset ecosystem.” With the continued explosion of the digital asset market in 2022, Fireblocks said it is determined to have an exceptional year, as they intend to continue its strategic expansion, broadening all alliances, adding to their client base and stakeholders, and tailoring their commitment to extending their ecosystem. As more consumers are requesting brands to support crypto, Fireblocks is creating opportunities for institutions that want to further acclimate their portfolios into the ecosystem. Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets. Fireblocks enables exchanges, lending desks, custodians, banks, trading desks, and hedge funds to securely scale digital asset operations through the Fireblocks Network and MPC-based Wallet Infrastructure. Fireblocks serves over 800 financial institutions, has secured the transfer of over $2 trillion in digital assets, and has a unique insurance policy that covers assets in storage and transit.

Eskine has launched an action seeking forfeiture of nearly $1 million in funds seized from a Robinhood Markets account. The complaint, seen by FX News Group, was submitted at the Georgia Northern District Court on January 24, 2022. This is a civil forfeiture action against $968,367.18 in funds seized from Robinhood Markets, Inc. account number XXXXX1342 held in the name of Choman Ali. The Defendant Funds were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on or about November 20, 2020, pursuant to a Federal seizure warrant, from Robinhood Markets, Inc. The Defendant Funds are presently located in a secure account maintained by the United States Marshals Service. Between April and May 2020, Choman Ali (Ali) applied for three Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and five Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans on behalf of his businesses. The investigation revealed that Ali used proceeds of the loans for purposes that were not approved by PPP and EIDL rules. Ali transferred the unlawfully obtained funds to his Robinhood account. For instance, between June 11 and June 22, 2020, $150,000 in funds were moved to the Robinhood Account via three $50,000 transfers, Then, between July 16 and July 28, 2020, $250,000 were moved to the Robinhood Account via five $50,000 transfers. The list continues… The Defendant Funds are subject to forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(C) on the grounds that the funds are derived from proceeds traceable to violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 (wire fraud) and 1344 (bank fraud). These funds are also subject to forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(A) because they constitute property involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 or 1957 (money laundering) or are property traceable to such property. The United States requests: that the Court forfeit the Defendant Funds to the United States ofAmerica; that the Court award Plaintiff the costs of this action; and that Plaintiff have such other and further relief as the Court deemsjust and proper under the facts and circumstances of this case."

The change from Henyep to HYCM seems to be in line with similar changes the company has made in other jurisdictions where it has regulated subsidiaries, e.g. Cyprus where it operates HYCM (Europe) Ltd. The group has gone to using the “HYCM” brand as its main retail moniker since 2016, with the Henyep Group kept for the parent company in Hong Kong. The Henyep Group, and the HYCM brand, are controlled by Chinese businessman Sheen Charm Chiu. The UK entity is run by CEO Roger Bach, and did £1.7 million in revenue with a net loss of £65,826 in 2020.

The broker is introducing a new indicator called “OANDA_Daily_Trade_Monitor“. The indicator is for traders who use the MT4 and MT5 platforms. It is especially useful for short-term traders who prefer scalping or day trading. With this indicator, traders can check trade details, such as daily profit/loss and risk/reward ratio. Furthermore, traders can make use of alerts based on pre-set parameters. The broker has proposed some basic wording for such alerts but traders can adjust this wording as they see fit (given that the alert does not exceed 31 characters). OANDA Japan regularly updates its education page. In January 2022, for instance, the broker introduced OANDA Trading Analysis. As one might guess, this indicator helps to analyze the trading results of a certain strategy (profit, loss, risks, etc). This way, traders can assess whether their trading strategies are successful or not. Another interesting addition is a ranking of the trading instruments offered by OANDA (Forex, CFDs, stock indices, commodities, and bonds) according to their price change (increase or decrease). This ranking enlists the top 10 movers for the past day. Traders with live accounts get access to additional information. They can use extra tools to customize the ranking. And, in November 2021, OANDA Lab introduced a section dedicated to expert advisors (EAs) – bots that do the trading according to preset algorithms removing the need for manual trading. Let’s note that EAs typically work on the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform. OANDA is one of the handful of Forex brokers in Japan that offer MT4."

In combination with currency conversion, this function will help you evaluate the exchange rate difference of the commodity assets you are interested in. Or you can convert the chart to see the price of the item in a more familiar unit of measurement. To change the unit of measure on a chart where conversion is available, you need to click on the button on the scale that displays the current unit and select the unit of measure you’re interested in from the drop-down list. After recalculation, the chart and indicators will display the price of the selected asset unit. Please note that, at the moment, there are some special behaviors to converted charts, which differ from TradingView’s usual charts. These include: If you change the symbol, the chart will be displayed in the original unit of measure. You cannot create an alert or place an order on the converted chart. Alerts and orders created in the original unit will continue to work exactly the same as before. Drawing objects created on the converted chart are available only on this converted chart – they are stored and displayed with reference to the symbol, currency and unit of measure. In the converted currency or unit of measure mode, the Bar Replay feature isn’t available. TradingView has been regularly enhancing its functionalities and adding new features. In January 2022, for instance, TradingView enabled instant synchronization of drawing objects. This new functionality will be useful for those working in multiple browser tabs at once, on multiple devices, or in a browser and desktop app at the same time. With the new ability to instantly sync drawing objects, your charts will always be up-to-date, no matter where they are open, whether it is a browser, a mobile app on iOS or Android, or the TradingView desktop app — simply enable the autosave feature in your chart settings."

This new feature is useful both for maintaining security and for recovering lost Brokerage transactions. “Book withdrawals on request” option In order to make our Forex CRM more flexible for Brokers,  a new option “Book withdrawals on request” has been added. It can be selected by the broker in the Broker Profile Tab. The withdrawal amount is debited from the client’s account at the time of the order and doesn’t require confirmation by the Broker. New Match-Trader platform chart settings We continue to improve our Match-Trader platform, therefore new settings for the chart were added for all users. From now on, each position on the chart includes a net profit.  We’ve also added the ability to show and hide positions and chart grid, which will certainly attract professional traders to your brokerage business. A French version of the Match-Trader trading platform Now our platform is also available in French. Apart from it, Match-Trader is already translated to: English, Indian, Russian, Persian, Korean, Arabic, Swedish, Spanish. It can be translated also to any other language upon request. “Unrealized profit loss” margin calculation method in the Match-Trader We’ve added the new margin counting mode in our Match-Trader forex trading platform. It’s set on a group in QFX Admin and applies to all accounts in a given group. Free margin in this mode is based on equity. Optimization of scroll through widget on mobile Match-Trader We pay high attention to the user experience of our products. Therefore we optimised the scroll through the widget on the mobile version of the Match-Trader platform. Now it is performed smoothly following the movement of the finger while widening and collapsing. “Reprocess” button in Withdrawals in CRM From now on, in our CRM for Brokers, when the withdrawal is failed, the “Reprocess” button appears in the extended request view. This small change allows Brokers to re-process (request) the withdrawal. Sales Dashboard – Tasks & History updates in CRM Unread tasks are now bolded like the rest of the dashboard events. Only tasks with the “done” status are transferred to the History (regardless of the start date). New options for showing Notional value in the Match-Trader Manger In February we’ve added some changes in the manager regarding positions. It is possible to check what is the value in USD of the opened positions by the traders. Making it easier for the Broker to check its exposure."

This indicator is based on TradingView’s Pitchfork drawing tool, which takes points traders set then connects them together and creates a channel with several different Fibonacci levels inside of it. The new indicator helps automate this process: instead of requiring traders to specify points by hand, it searches for last notable pivot points and draws the pitchfork based on them. As a result, the pitchfork can be shown on any desired symbol automatically. The Inputs section in the indicator’s settings allows traders to further tweak it to their preference: they can add new Fibonacci levels to the pitchfork and recolor them, change the type of the pitchfork used, and affect the length of the analyzed data via the Depth input. The indicator is written in TradingView’s own Pine scripting language, so Pine enthusiasts can take a closer look at how it works in the Pine Editor. If you want to examine the inner workings of the indicator or modify it for your personal use, click on the “Open” button, select “New default built-in script” from the dropdown and find Auto Pitchfork there. Speaking of recent enhancements to the TradingView platform, let’s note that TradingView has enabled instant synchronization of drawing objects. This new functionality will be useful for those working in multiple browser tabs at once, on multiple devices, or in a browser and desktop app at the same time. Now traders do not need to reload charts to see changes made elsewhere. With the new ability to instantly sync drawing objects, your charts will always be up-to-date, no matter where they are open, whether it is a browser, a mobile app on iOS or Android, or the TradingView desktop app — simply enable the autosave feature in your chart settings. This means less time wasting and more productivity — allowing you to focus more on your trading."

According to the amended complaint, seen by FX News Group, between 2018 and 2021, the plaintiffs and similarly situated customers were victims of a nearly $75 million international scheme that defrauded them of money or cash equivalents. The scheme—hosted entirely on RoFx.net—lured victims with a purported “robotically operated foreign exchange trading” platform, which promised safe, easy, and highly lucrative profits. The RoFx Scheme revolved around a supposed artificially intelligent algorithm which could identify profitable foreign exchange trades to be executed by third-party brokers. Customers were enticed to contribute their funds to the Scheme—and, in return for a service fee, customers would earn passive income, courtesy of the RoFx software and its network of brokers. The Scheme was promoted online via, inter alia, elaborately crafted sponsored content disguised as legitimate financial reporting—which was cited or republished by major news outlets. The entire Scheme was an online fiction. There is no RoFx entity running any smart trading software. No foreign exchange trading was done using RoFx customer funds. The RoFx Scheme had only one purpose: steal as much money as possible from their “customers” and keep them from realizing what was actually happening until it was too late. And for nearly four years the RoFx Scheme was wildly successful, bilking unsuspecting victims of $75 million or more. The Scheme was fictitious but the harm very real. After obtaining monies from their victims, the persons operating the RoFx Scheme (the “RoFx Operators”) laundered the funds through a complicated, globe-sprawling web of ever- shifting shell companies and financial institutions. This next phase—the Money Laundering Enterprise—includes dozens of persons and entities spanning at least three continents. Defendants went to extraordinary lengths to steal and conceal. However, despite their best efforts, Plaintiffs and their counsel have begun to unravel the shroud of secrecy and confusion Defendants created with such deliberate care and caution. Plaintiffs now bring this action on behalf of a global class of RoFx customers."

A report of infringement can be submitted either by name or anonymously. CySEC has the following communication channels for receiving a report of infringement and for contacting the dedicated staff members of the competent department: a) Phone line: +357 22 506 750. When using this phone line, the conversations are recorded, only with the consent of the reporting person. b) Electronic address: whistleblowing@cysec.gov.cy c) Postal address: Diagorou 19, 1097 Nicosia, Cyprus, for the attention of Market Surveillance and Investigations Department marked as “CONFIDENTIAL”. d) Arrangement of a physical meeting with the dedicated staff members of the competent department which can be scheduled following an oral request of the reporting person to the phone line. The reporting person may submit written report of infringement by completing the “Whistleblowing External Disclosure Form” and sending it through the communication channels. CySEC upon receipt of an oral or written report of infringement, informs in writing the reporting person within how many days will be notified about the results of the inquiry to his/her postal or electronic address, if such has been provided, and ensures that the relevant notification will be sent within the timeframe set. In case that postal or electronic address has not been provided, CySEC provides the above information orally to the reporting person, given that a contact number has been provided. In case that the reporting person has not provided any contact details, he/she can be provided with the above information orally, by contacting the dedicated staff members of the competent department to the phone line set out in the provisions of paragraph A3a above. CySEC promptly sends a receipt confirmation in relation to the receipt of written reports of infringements to the postal or electronic address indicated by the reporting person, unless the reporting person explicitly requested otherwise or CySEC reasonable believes that acknowledging receipt of a written report would jeopardise the protection of the reporting person’s identity. Where a telephone line is used for the reporting of infringements, with the exception of those cases in which the reporting person has not provided his/her consent for the recording of the conversation, CySEC has the right to document the oral reporting in the form of: a) an audio recording of the conversation in a durable and retrievable form; or b) a complete and accurate transcript of the conversation prepared by the dedicated staff members of the competent department. In cases where the reporting person has disclosed his/her identity, CySEC offers the possibility to the reporting person to check, rectify and agree with the transcript of the call by signing it. With regards to the confidentiality regime applicable to the report of infringement, CySEC draws the attention of the reporting person to the following circumstances in which the confidential information of a reporting person may be published: in the context of a civil or criminal or other legal proceeding or in the context of arbitration or out of court settlement, where CySEC is requested to provide evidence or give testimony or during the provision of statements in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, in the context that CySEC lodges complaints to any other competent authorities, associations, organizations or bodies in the Republic or abroad, in the context of the right to be heard of the reported person or any other person who is invited to representations to CySEC, giving access to such person to the information of the relevant administrative file. It is highlighted that personal data, in the context of the report of infringement, is kept for a maximum period of five years. It is pointed out that, in accordance with article 6(6) of the Market Abuse Law of 2016 (N.102(I)/2016), a person providing information to CySEC, in accordance with the Regulation, is not considered to be infringing any restriction on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by any legislative, regulatory or administrative provision, nor will the said person have liability of any kind related to such disclosure."

ADSS said that the hire complements a series of key senior executive hires over the past 12 months that will support the firm’s ambitious strategy to expand its retail and institutional securities brokerage with cutting edge technology, processes and best-in-class product experiences for its customers. However ADSS has also been hit with a number of top-level departures over the past few months, most recently its CFO Jo Page and Human Resources chief Kevin Ball. Sophia Salim brings to ADSS 17 years of global experience in technology product innovation and has worked across a range of global corporations, including Microsoft, where she was a software engineer. She also co-founded Ropazi, a San Francisco-based commerce platform start-up that was supported by StartX, an accelerator for Stanford-affiliated entrepreneurs. Prior to joining ADSS, she was the Dubai-based Chief Product Officer at Bykea, a ride-hailing start-up in Pakistan. Sophia Salim, ADSS’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer, said: “I am excited to be joining ADSS amid its rapid and transformational growth. As we continue to differentiate ourselves in a competitive marketplace, we will seek ways to bring our clients innovative and best-in-class experiences and propositions that meet their evolving needs. I look forward to working with the highly capable executive team to further enhance the business’s product line up as we strive to deliver greater value to our institutional and retail clients.” The news is part of the company’s broader executive team expansion, and it marks a notable focus on the company’s plans to become a next generation broker with seamless and personalised experiences that enable customers to trade with confidence. The addition of Ms Salim to ADSS’s executive committee also enhances the firm’s commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace. This is further bolstered by the promotion of Budoor Alkhaaldi to the role of Chief Human Resources Officer. Ms Alkhaaldi is also the first Emirati to join the Leadership team. Following the most recent appointments, women now represent more than 30% of ADSS’s senior leadership team. The other recent hires to the leadership team driving ADSS through the next phase of growth are: Dave Worsfold, Chief Operations Officer – Previously Director of Operations for CMC Markets; Theo Papathanasiou, Chief Client Officer – Previously Regional Sales Director at Interactive Brokers and Head of Global Sales Trading at Saxo Bank; Jo Benton, Chief Marketing Officer – Previously Head of Marketing for Saxo Capital Markets UK and Head of Marketing EMEA at StoneX Retail; Sheena Kanabar, Chief Compliance Officer – Previously Head of Compliance at CMC Markets; and Vinod Pal, Chief Data Officer – Previously Head of Data Product for Reckitt and Head of Data for WorldRemit. Theo Papathanasiou, Chief Client Officer, said: “ADSS is at an exciting point of its journey as we build upon our leading position in the Middle East and expand our operations in key global markets. We are driving our new growth strategy forward at an accelerated pace and welcome Sophia to the team as we continue to embed key principles of innovation into our organisation.” ADSS’s most recent additions to its executive committee follows the appointment of Rocco Paduano, formerly Head of Global Market Risk Management at Saxo Bank, as Chief Risk Officer. Completing the Leadership team are long standing ADSS executives Marios Kampouridis as Chief Technology Officer and Khaldoun Sharaiha as Global Head of Sales. ADSS was founded in 2010 with the mission of creating a global financial services company delivering the highest quality products and services. Through significant investment into proprietary multi-asset trading technology, this has enabled access to liquidity and instruments to meet such a goal. Investment in developing experienced, highly qualified teams has helped place ADSS as a leader in global business. ADSS is regulated by the Securities and Commodities Authority of the UAE, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK."

Net Zero Emission targets stem from the breakthrough 2015 Paris Agreement, where countries committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to keep global temperature increase in the 21st century to under 2 degrees Celsius. The 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, although a diluted form of the initial proposal, was the first time a major deal between nations acknowledged that fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change. The acknowledgement led to the adoption of the Net Zero target into many legislative, regulative, and investment policies in the six years between Paris and Glasgow. Fast forward to 2022. The global economy is struggling to regain its momentum after the pandemic crisis and depends heavily on high emissions for growth. We collectively emit over 50 billion tons of CO2 equivalents annually, over 40% above the emissions in 1990. China, which was expected to spearhead global economies out of the pandemic-led contraction, tops the chart, emitting twice as much as the world’s largest economy, the United States of America. The other emerging BRIC countries (Brazil, India, and Russia) are not too far behind in emissions. As the efforts towards the Net Zero by 2050 target ramp, what’s the economic impact of scaling back emissions? What if We Do Nothing? The impact of doing nothing is a critical consideration in evaluating the impact of Net Zero. Even if economies ignore the devastating human cost, climate change does pose a substantial financial risk. An increase in average global temperatures is already causing erratic weather patterns, rising sea levels, reduced food security, higher health risks, geopolitical conflicts, and the mass displacement of communities. Over the last 50 years, climate change-related disasters have increased fivefold, causing $202 million in economic damage every day. Insurance Firm SwissRe forecasts a reduction in global GDP by 14% ($23 trillion) by 2050, compared to a world without climate change. That loss is higher than the 2019 GDP of the US, which stood at $21.43 trillion. Bank of America (BofA) analysts estimate a $69 trillion reduction in global GDP if climate change is ignored. The analysts believe that this could wipe out $2.3 trillion of equity value by 2100. On the other hand, there are significant costs associated with meeting the Net Zero target. Economic Impacts of the Transition The Net Zero by 2050 target has been set by more than 70 countries, covering 76% of global emissions. Most have chosen 2050 as the deadline (China targets 2060). The EU has pledged to become the first carbon-neutral continent. If followed, the investments to fulfil these pledges come at a significant price tag. There are seven energy and land-use systems that create the world’s CO2 and methane emissions: · Power · Industry · Mobility · Buildings · Agriculture · Forestry · Waste The most exposed sectors to divestment are high-level emission production or operations such as: · Steel · Cement · Oil & gas · Agriculture Investment in more efficient production and the transition to renewables will reduce demand for these sectors and reshape the supply mix. Changing Opportunities According to McKinsey, capital spending on physical assets will amount to $275 trillion during the transition period, or $9.2 trillion a year. The current annual capital spending lags the target amount by $3.5 trillion. This represents a massive investment opportunity for companies. The increase equals around half the global corporate profits recorded in 2020. Estimates vary, however. While considering total investments (rather than just in physical assets), the IMF estimates a cumulative increase of $20 trillion, while Reuters’s economists suggest $44 trillion. The capital spending and fiscal support need to be front-loaded funded between now and 2030. Estimates indicate a steep decline in the demand for fossil fuels during the transition, with a complete halt in coal, a 55% reduction in oil and a 70% in gas demands. Renewables and nuclear power will replace fossil fuels. Goods that contain carbon, such as plastics, will drive the demand for petroleum. Jobs in the fossil fuel power sector are expected to be 60% lower but estimated to be replaced and surpassed by millions of jobs in renewable power. BofA forecasts 42 million green jobs under a $5 trillion per annum increase in investments. The increased investment offers considerable opportunities in new high-growth green sectors. The market sentiment for renewable energies is balanced, according to Acuity’s Sentiment Widget. For Automobiles, demand is expected to shift almost entirely to EVs and fuel-cell cars during the transition period, led by public transport and subsequently automobile ownership. Companies will also have new sectors to explore in de-carbonising or low-emission products, new green products and support offerings such as lithium and cobalt mining. BofA also expects increased annual investment in moon-shot technologies of $2 trillion that will come to fruition by 2050 to achieve goals. An attractive market for carbon will also increase investment opportunities. Only 20% of world carbon is covered by carbon credits or taxes, leading to significant under-pricing compared to emission targets. Increases in carbon pricing and production cost could cause inflation, but new technologies are likely to boost GDP enough, creating slack to absorb moderate inflationary pressures. Carbon taxes in Canada and Europe have, in the past, reduced household demand and lowered prices. The Net Zero transition puts the global economy on the road to more sustainable productivity, generating value in new and existing technologies and operations, while keeping away the decimating forces of climate change. The result is a more resilient and deeper economy that has considerably reduced one of its most exigent risks. On the other hand, there are caveats. The projections by experts are mostly based on a stable and coordinated global transition, and there are risks related to weather event disruptions if the transition is delayed. Currently, none of the Paris or Glasgow signatories is on course to meet targets. If the transition is not given enough time, there can also be instability from labour market disruptions."

City Index is a unit of US-based brokerage firm StoneX Group Inc (NASDAQ:SNEX), acquired by StoneX in 2020 as part of its purchase of Gain Capital and the Forex.com Retail FX brand. Gain Capital bought City Index in 2014. City Index operates mainly in the UK online trading market, with Australia being its #2 (and only other major) market. In the rebrand, gone are City Index’s familiar yellow, black and white logo and look, replaced by a decidedly younger and more edgy purple. As noted, the new logo and look are operational now only for the company’s Australia website cityindex.com/en-au/, while the group’s “main” UK site cityindex.co.uk is remaining (for now) with the original branding. We understand that the company is going to study the rebrand (and some other changes) in Australia, before a planned rollout in the UK later in 2022. Tom Brown, Head of Australia at City Index said of the rebrand: “The key to our longevity has always been to build our service model around the needs of the client. We share the passion of trading with our clients and have built an ecosystem of trading excellence that is designed to support their goals – we are here to serve traders, and our new corporate branding highlights a partnership of trust and shared success.” City Index has been operating in Australia since 2006, and recently made an investment to grow its brand locally via a sponsorship deal with as Platinum Partner for Sydney Roosters rugby. In Australia City Index offers trading in CFDs, Knockout Options and futures, via a webtrader or the MT4 platform."

Swissquote had earlier (in mid January) released its summary results for 2021, showing record annual revenues and profits despite a slower second half of the year. As far as new “news”, Swissquote said that during the two first months of 2022, customer growth continued its strong trend with CHF 1.4 billion (USD $1.49 billion) of net new monies. The company said that that despite current geopolitical and market uncertainty, it expects to replicate its very successful year 2021. In 2022, net revenues are expected at CHF 475 million (+0.7% YoY) and pre-tax profit at CHF 225 million (+0.7%). The new medium-term targets put net revenues and pre-tax profit at CHF 750 million and CHF 350 million respectively in 2025. With the acquisition of Keytrade Bank Luxembourg announced earlier this year, Swissquote said it has reinforced its positioning in the Benelux area as a market leader in online trading and investing. The Keytrade transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, and will bring in somewhat more than 8,200 new customers and EUR 1.7 billion in client assets. With this move, Swissquote confirms its ambitious expansion strategy in Europe and more generally outside of Switzerland. Interestingly, Swissquote took its results release as an opportunity to announce changes in its corporate organization, which will include: ❑ Paolo Buzzi will be proposed as a new member of the Board of Directors at the next Annual General Meeting. Paolo Buzzi is one of the two founders of the company and has been key to its success. His engineering degree from the EPFL, his strong  information technology culture and his affinity for innovation were instrumental in the launch of Swissquote as a digital bank and in countless projects. Paolo is stepping down as Deputy CEO on the Executive Management and, if he is elected, he will continue to actively contribute to the Swissquote success story as a Board member. ❑ Demetra Kalogerou will also be proposed to the Board of Directors as an additional member. Boasting a wide range of experiences, Demetra Kalogerou in particular used to be for 10 years the Executive Chairwoman of the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC). If she is elected, she will bring to the Board a broader international dimension as well as a strong expertise in financial markets, regulation and risk management. ❑ Martin Naville, a long-standing member of the Board of Directors since 2007 and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Swissquote Bank Ltd since 2019, will not be standing for reelection at this year’s Annual General Meeting. With his wide experience, he has contributed significantly to the success and growth of Swissquote. Markus Dennler, Chairman of the Board of Directors, said: “With the proposed candidates, we are significantly strengthening our Board of Directors and are pursuing Swissquote’s growth story. In addition to this, we warmly thank Martin Naville for his significant contribution to the company over the last 15 years.” Regarding its results, Swissquote indicated that its eForex trading volumes averaged $129 billion monthly in 2021, up from $114 billion in 2020. Operating revenues at Swissquote increased in 2021 by 49 percent year-on-year to CHF 479.6 million, while pre-tax profit reached a record high of CHF 223.3 million (target for 2024 was CHF 200 million), an increase of 111.4 percent. Profitability, with a pre-tax profit margin of 47.3 percent, increased strongly thanks to higher trading volumes and more customer accounts (+77,599). With organic net new money inflow hitting a record high of CHF 9.6 billion, client assets grew to CHF 55.9 billion. The Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the dividend be increased by 46.7 percent from CHF 1.50 to CHF 2.20 per share. Net new money inflow at Swissquote continued to increase to CHF 9.6 billion in 2021 (CHF 5.3 billion). This trend is attributable to Swissquote’s international expansion (52% of the net new monies were related to customers resident abroad), as well as the unique positioning of Swissquote for mass affluent customers. Client assets rose by 40.5 percent to CHF 55.9 billion (CHF 39.8 billion) thanks to net new money inflow, but also to the positive market environment. Per customer, this equates to a healthy average deposit in excess of CHF 110,000. The total number of accounts reached 487,847 (+18.9 percent) by the end of 2021. Swissquote’s full results release for 2021 can be seen here (pdf)."

The last years have seen most FX brokers opt for a football led marketing strategy. With the density of deals and increasing clutter in football, how can brands find different opportunities to stand out from the crowd? Football still remains the most popular sport of choice for the online trading sector since 2010 when the first broker sports deals came on the scene. Since then, over 70% of investment into sports sponsorship has been allocated to football related deals. Nearly every club in the top European leagues now has an online trading partner – on the shirt, on the sleeve, on the back of the shirt or as a global/regional partner. Along with sports betting, online trading now represents one of the largest number of sponsorships than other brand sectors with teams, players, managers and events. Add crypto into the mix and the percentage of investment increases significantly. Why football ? It is demographically relevant to the client base, it offers significant tangible benefits such as brand exposure to global audiences, and a transfer of intangible benefits such as credibility by association to world class partners who enjoy sporting success. But the football sector is seeing a greater deal of density than ever before, there may be a  point that another broker announcing yet another football deal doesn’t quite hit the mark that it used to. Brokers are starting to look for standout in a market that is becoming increasingly cluttered. One route round this issue within football itself has been to dominate the landscape. Etoro  as example now have partnerships with over 20 clubs around Europe giving them permanent visibility week in week out. Another issue has recently come into play. Whilst FX brokers are now expanding into crypto related sectors, this creates complex product category discussions with rights holders who are trying to maximise the revenue from every angle of online trading. Online trading as a category used to be quite straightforward but not anymore. In many cases a greater investment is needed to ensure exclusivity across multiple category sectors. So where have brokers been turning their attention to and where else can they find standout in the from their peers? Formula1 was a staple platform for brokers several years ago, multiple teams had an FX sponsor, but most gradually moved to football. Today only one team has an FX partner. But F1 has become relevant again, the Netflix Drive to Survive has opened the sport to a new audience, no longer petrol heads but a mass audience who have been lured in by the behind scenes insight to the sport. F1 has created its own successful esports series, audiences are increasing and digital platforms are generating significant return on investment. Speed and trading have always gone hand in hand, F1 offers better opportunities than ever before. A number of other sports are also seeing changes that have drawn in brokers. Tennis is one of them. It is seeing a new era where the same three top players no longer dominate. A global sport it however also allows sponsors to carve out territorial deals for markets of importance. More brokers have been doing rugby sponsorships than ever before. A sport that has less global exposure than football, it however provides a more upscale audience with higher disposable income. For brokers who also target a B2B audience, sports like golf and sailing have evolved into more sponsor friendly environments. These types of sports compete harder for sponsorship revenue, they are more adaptable to finding solutions to draw in clients. Regionality continues to play a huge part and as brokers are continually expanding, markets like MENA, LATAM, South Africa offer opportunities for brokers to partner with sports that are strong in the region, be it golf in Dubai or rugby in South Africa and UFC in Brazil which remains the most followed sport after football. The pandemic had a massive impact on sports but one that saw a reversal of fortune in a positive direction has been esports. 1 in 3 people on the planet are gamers, 2020 saw biggest ever growth in esports. The audience is tech savvy, digital orientated by nature, and high disposable income (67% household income over €85k [Nielsen]), average age 23, 74% Male. In 2021 there were over thirty esports deals done by crypto exchanges alone, one of the fastest paces of sponsorship investment ever seen. The esports market is relevant and huge for brokers, we are sure to see much more investment into esports. What will the future bring? Potentially big sponsorships in the Metaverse! Football will still play a major part of broker investment but brokers can be assured there are many alternatives out there. Stephen Pearson, founder of Sports Media Gaming Ltd, has brokered multiple sponsorships for FX and crypto brands, most recently ThinkMarkets global sponsorship of Liverpool FC, Vantage’s sponsorship with McLaren Extreme E, and Bit Stamp Exchanges global esports partnerships in North America and Europe."

The broker is introducing a new indicator called “OANDA_Support_Resistance”. The solution is recommended to traders using MT4 / MT5. As the name of the indicator suggests, it draws the levels of support and resistance on the chart. Specifically, the levels are calculated using fractals on three time axes: long-term, medium-term, and short-term. The level of support and resistance is displayed as dots. OANDA Japan regularly updates its education page. In January 2022, for instance, the broker introduced OANDA Trading Analysis. This indicator helps to analyze the trading results of a certain strategy (profit, loss, risks, etc). This way, traders can assess whether their trading strategies are successful or not. Another interesting addition is a ranking of the trading instruments offered by OANDA (Forex, CFDs, stock indices, commodities, and bonds) according to their price change (increase or decrease). This ranking enlists the top 10 movers for the past day. Traders with live accounts get access to additional information. They can use extra tools to customize the ranking. And, in November 2021, OANDA Lab introduced a section dedicated to expert advisors (EAs) – bots that do the trading according to preset algorithms removing the need for manual trading. Let’s note that EAs typically work on the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform. OANDA is one of the handful of Forex brokers in Japan that offer MT4."

Higo appointed TORA because it delivered a sophisticated Japanese GUI, advanced trade management and position monitoring tools with a strong compliance engine that is set up for Japanese market regulation requirements. Higo users can now safely monitor their trading activities, capture the entire trading history of each stock on a real-time basis and compare current positions. It was imperative the new system automated the bank’s strong trading policy and processes, additionally TORA’s functionality around compliance and approvals was a key factor. Higo was also very keen to invest in a hosted environment platform to reduce their initial IT cost overhead. Finally the system had to have the flexibility to integrate execution data flows with their existing middle and back office workflow and perform all the necessary regulatory functions. Higo traders will now have access to a broad network of domestic and foreign brokers and venues via the TORA proprietary FIX network. The system offers access to over 500 of the latest multi-asset broker algos, a powerful alerts engine and order monitoring tool in one easy to use interface that delivers greater cost savings in a more efficient front to back operation. Atsushi Kouda at Higo Bank commented: “We chose TORA because we need a cutting edge trading platform specializing in the Japanese market. Additionally the hosted environment infrastructure allowed us to control our costs but still integrate with our internal systems.” Takanori Takase, Representative Director for Japan at TORA stated: “We are delighted that Higo Bank has picked TORA’s OEMS to enable them to access the latest trading technologies. Our product and implementation teams have worked closely with Higo to ensure their integration and compliance needs are met. Our native Japanese support team ensures that we can fully support the bank in their needs. We are looking forward to a long relationship with Higo.” TORA’s EMS offers the most comprehensive front-to-back end trading solution for hedge funds and asset managers. The leading technology is fully auditable and automatically details in depth order records, price information, analytics and creates best execution reports. It covers global markets in equities, fixed income, futures, options and FX. London Stock Exchange Group (LON:LSEG) announced earlier this year that it has agreed to acquire TORA, for $325 million."

The performance was driven by the consistent strength and increasing scale of Plus500’s technology to enable customers’ trading activities across a wide range of geographic markets, products and financial instruments. Revenue in Q1 2022 was $270.9m (Q4 2021: $161.1m, Q1 2021: $203.2m). Customer Income, a key measure of the Group’s underlying performance, was again robust at $188.0m in the quarter (Q4 2021: $166.7m, Q1 2021: $221.5m). Customer Trading Performance during Q1 2022 stood at $82.9m, (Q4 2021: ($5.6m), Q1 2021: ($18.3m)). The Company continues to expect that the contribution from Customer Trading Performance will be broadly neutral over time. EBITDA in Q1 2022 was $161.6m (Q4 2021: $70.9m, Q1 2021: $121.7m) with EBITDA margin of 60% (Q4 2021: 44%, Q1 2021: 60%). This EBITDA performance was supported by the Company’s lean, flexible cost base and efficient business model. The numbers of New Customers and Active Customers on the Group’s trading platforms remained strong during Q1 2022, but were below the particularly elevated levels of Q1 2021. The Group on-boarded 33,740 New Customers in Q1 2022 (Q4 2021: 33,187, Q1 2021: 89,406), driven by continued investments in its marketing technology. Active Customers during Q1 2022 were ahead of the sequential quarter at 176,642 (Q4 2021: 171,922, Q1 2021: 269,743) driven by the Company’s investments in innovation and product development, which helped to deliver a range of initiatives aimed at deepening engagement with the Group’s customers. As a result of these initiatives, ARPU was resilient at $1,534 in Q1 2022 (Q4 2021: $937, Q1 2021: $753). AUAC in Q1 2022 improved from the sequential quarter at $1,416 (Q4 2021: $1,502, Q1 2021: $473), driven by on-going investments in strategic markets to attract high value customers. The Group continues to expect that AUAC will rise steadily over time, as the Group invests in attracting customers to the new trading products in its portfolio and targeting customers in strategic geographies. Client deposits remained heightened at $0.6bn in Q1 2022 (Q4 2021: $0.5bn, Q1 2021: $0.7bn), reflecting customers’ on-going confidence in Plus500’s technology and growing product portfolio. The Company repurchased 771,409 shares in the quarter, at an average price of £14.32, for a total cash consideration of $14.8m, as part of its most recent share buyback programme, announced at the Group’s FY 2021 preliminary results on 15 February 2022, to purchase up to $55.0m of the Company’s shares. In terms of strategic achievements, Plus500 notes that, in February 2022, it announced that the Group’s portfolio of operating licences was further strengthened with the addition of a new licence in Estonia, granted by the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority. This new licence, supported by the establishment of a new local operating subsidiary, will act as an additional foundation to the Group’s business across European markets in its core product offering. In March 2022, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of EZ Invest Securities, Co., Ltd., a regulated entity licenced as a Type 1 Financial Instruments Business Operator, offering CFDs and OTC Foreign Exchange in Japan. This acquisition expands the Company’s geographic footprint into the substantial Japanese retail trading market, where Plus500 will apply its financial and technological strength to scale and develop the acquired business over time. The integration of the acquisitions made in the US futures market last year is on track, with good progress made in leveraging Plus500’s best-in-class technology to optimise the acquired businesses. This will help to deliver market access to the millions of potential customers looking for new trading opportunities and solutions in the futures and options on futures market. During Q1 2022, the Group became a full Clearing Firm Member of the CME Group, having successfully obtained all the clearing membership privileges required to clear exchange-traded futures and options on futures on the CME Group’s exchanges. This offers an additional potential revenue opportunity for Plus500. The Group’s proprietary share dealing platform, ‘Plus500 Invest’, was rolled out in additional countries, with new equities and ETFs added to the product offering during the period, and is now available as a native application on the Android and iOS operating systems. During the period, the Company continued to invest in technology innovation and product development, to help further drive engagement with customers, including the on-going recruitment at the Company’s R&D centres in Israel. At the current time, the Board anticipates that revenue for FY 2022 will be ahead of current market expectations and continues to expect that Plus500 will deliver sustainable growth from all of the Group’s product offerings over the medium to long term. David Zruia, Chief Executive Officer of Plus500, commented: “Plus500 has produced excellent results for Q1 2022, continuing our significant operational and financial momentum over recent years, and validating our clear strategic roadmap. Our on-going investments in developing our position as a global multi-asset fintech group will enable future growth. In particular, we continue to make organic investments in technology, marketing and our people, as well as actively targeting additional acquisitions and initiating potential strategic partnerships.”"

On April 25, 2022, Judge Nathanael Cousins of the California Northern District Court signed an order dismissing the case against the broker. This case, concerning allegations that Interactive Brokers LLC (IBKR) aided and abetted Haena Park in a Ponzi fraud scheme, was before the Court on a second motion to dismiss. The Court had previously dismissed the complaint finding that Plaintiff Benjamin Chang failed to allege that IBKR had actual knowledge of Park’s fraud and breach of fiduciary duties. The Court has evaluated whether Chang’s first amended complaint (FAC) cured these deficiencies. Having considered the briefing and the parties’ arguments, the Court granted IBKR’s second motion to dismiss without leave to amend. In this case, Benjamin Chang sues Interactive Brokers on behalf of himself, and other victims of a Ponzi scheme devised by Haena Park and conducted on Interactive Brokers LLC’s trading platform. Chang alleges that IBKR aided and abetted Park in facilitating her fraudulent scheme and breaching her fiduciary duties to her investors, resulting in the loss of over $14 million of investor contributions. The first amended complaint adds the following relevant allegations: IBKR conducted automated and manual compliance reviews to assign investors, including Park, risk profiles. Because of Park’s “excessive losses and deposits,” IBKR elevated her risk profile rating and increased its focus on her account. Through its reviews IBKR knew: Park was experienced in the financial industry and likely to have connections to third-party investors; Park was an individual “at-home” trader who was not permitted to pool third-party funds through her IBKR account; Park consistently deposited and invested more than her net worth through her IBKR account; Park’s losses consistently exceeded what her means would normally be able to sustain; and Park continued to make frequent cash deposits and risky trades despite the losses. The first amended complaint further alleges that “IBKR may not have had specific knowledge of certain details of Park’s scheme, such as the exact number of her investors, the identities of her investors, or the specific misrepresentations she made to her investors regarding their investments.” But IBKR did “know” or “conclude” that Park’s account was “necessarily” using third-party investor funds. Despite this awareness, IBKR compliance officers “overrode” the automated compliance review to allow Park to continue trading. Finally, the first amended complaint adds that IBKR violated California’s Unfair Competition Law by violating federal regulations requiring futures commodity merchants and Commodity Futures Trade Commission registrants to diligently supervise commodity interest accounts and to report certain activity involving funds obtained by illegal activity. IBKR’s motion to dismiss reiterated the arguments it raised in its first motion to dismiss–the FAC fails to state a claim for aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty because it does not sufficiently allege IBKR’s “actual knowledge” of Park’s scheme or IBKR’s “substantial assistance” in the scheme; the UCL claim is insufficient because it relies on the insufficient aiding and abetting allegations; and all claims are time barred. After reviewing the deficiencies identified in the Court’s previous order and evaluating the new allegations in the FAC, the Court found that the allegations are still insufficient to state a claim. Thus, the Court granted IBKR’s motion to dismiss. Because Chang already had the opportunity to correct the same deficiency and was unable to plead additional facts to support his claim, the Court concluded that granting leave to amend would be futile."

The Covid-19 pandemic triggered several unprecedented events in the financial markets. We saw negative oil prices, US circuit breakers kicking in three times in the span of a week, and gold prices hitting a record high of $ 2074.88. The yellow metal’s move to a historic high, with investors’ flight to safety, was not surprising. Post this peak, gold prices subsided, with investor risk appetite being supported by rapid reopening of economies and an impressive global vaccine rollout. Although investors moved to higher-yielding assets, gold didn’t go off their radar. The Backdrop is Perfect for a Gold Rally Fast forward to 2022. Economic growth is once again uncertain. The Russia-Ukraine war has worsened the supply crunch, feeding into the commodity supercycle predicted by analysts as the pandemic waned. The resultant impact on overall inflation is posing massive challenges for policymakers worldwide. Even Japan, which has struggled with deflation since the 1990s, has seen a return to inflation. US inflation accelerated to 8.5% in March, the highest since the Great Inflation of the 1980s. The Euro Area recorded an annual inflation rate of 7.5% in March, making it the fifth consecutive month of hitting new records. Gold has returned to the limelight. After all, it’s the perfect asset – a safe haven (amid the war) and a traditional inflation hedge. Spot prices reached $1,937. However, a combination of factors means that the yellow metal is unlikely to shine as brightly as it did in 2020. Although the sentiment for the yellow metal is positive, the curve is on a downward trajectory, despite the continued geopolitical and economic concerns, as can be seen on Acuity’s Sentiment Widget. Why Gold May Not Breach $2,000 Anytime Soon Inflation With worsening supply chain constraints and economic activity recovering only moderately, the focus of the major central banks (Fed, ECB, BoE) has shifted to inflation. Let’s take the US as an example. After maintaining a dovish tone for the better part of two years, the Federal Reserve has turned strongly hawkish. The May meeting could see policymakers hike the benchmark interest rate by as much as 0.5% and approve plans to shrink their oversized asset portfolio. The market’s heightening expectations of Fed rate hikes has pushed the 10-year US treasury rate from 1.56% in January to the current 2.76%. Rising yields increases the opportunity cost of holding non-interest yielding assets, like gold. Such sentiments could continue to dampen gold prices. Despite the IMF lowering its projections for global economic growth and the resurgence of infections in China, analysts maintain their yield estimates around 3%. The 3% nominal yield level for the 10-year US treasury has historically formed a resistance level, most recently seen in 2018. The Fed now aims to snip these heightened inflation expectations in the bud and to frontend their rate hikes. This limits the potential of any gold rally in the near term. However, it’s important to bear in mind that the Fed can’t raise rates too fast, as this has serious consequences for the labour market. The weakening in gold will likely be proportionate to how quickly the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Slowdown in Economic Growth After a year of pandemic-led restrictions, investors were looking forward to a strong economic recovery. Markets took various challenges, like the semiconductor shortage, supply chain issues and labour market disruptions, in their stride. However, they couldn’t ignore the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war. Experts have lowered their estimates for global economic growth. US GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 3% in 2022. This means central banks will need to spread out their interest rate hikes through the year, while simultaneously addressing supply-side pressures. This spells continued weakness in gold. The Dual Impact of the Greenback Gold is not the only safe-haven option. The US dollar is a very popular safe-haven asset for traders and investors alike. With the Fed expected to hike interest rates, market participants may gravitate to the US dollar in the face of geopolitical turmoil or economic concerns. On the other hand, gold prices are expressed in US dollars in the global markets (XAU/USD). This means any spike in the greenback makes gold more expensive for investors and traders from other countries. The US dollar index (DXY) has gained 6.21% year to date. The DXY has steadily appreciated due to capital flowing out of emerging markets. The situation was heightened by Russia moving to the perceived safety of USD denominated securities. The DXY is also being boosted by monetary tightening tailwinds. On April 26, the US dollar hit a 2-year high on expectations of the Fed’s balance sheet trimming and a slowdown in China’s growth due to Covid restrictions. The US dollar is also buoyed by the uneven rise in rates between the US and its leading trading partner, EU. While the Fed is incredibly hawkish, the ECB had refrained from taking the same stance. As per ECB President Christine Lagarde, as much as half the inflationary pressures stem from rising energy costs due to the Ukraine war. However, much of the energy demand is for non-discretionary purposes, so raising rates will have only a minimal impact on demand and, therefore, on energy prices and inflation. The difference in stance of the Fed and ECB will continue to support the US dollar. The euro has already depreciated by 5.7% against the greenback so far in 2022. Such price uptrends for the greenback may continue in the near term, posing a headwind for gold through most of 2022. Once the Russia-Ukraine situation eases and global economic growth begins to accelerate, higher risk appetite may further limit gold’s prospects."

That was a fairly large increase from just £1.7 million in 2020, but still led to a Net Loss of £17.1 million for the year. The London based company said that Revenue is expected to continue increasing in the next financial year from an annualisation of new customer subscription revenue, new customer acquisition and higher trading volumes. The Group’s loss is attributable to an increased level of costs. The most significant cost is headcount and there has been a significant investment in the Product and Engineering functions to drive the development of Freetrade’s investment app and to drive expansion into new markets. There has been a strategic investment in marketing activity throughout the year, compared with the previous financial year, further contributing to the Net Loss. Over the financial year the total headcount across all locations increased by 121, to a total headcount of 201 at 30 September 2021 (2020: 80). We had recently reported that Freetrade raised an additional £30 million in funding in the form of a convertible loan, and at the time Freetrade reported that its 2021 calendar Revenues topped £15 million  – meaning that calendar Q4 2021 must have been a big improvement over Q1. Freetrade also said earlier this month that its registered users have surpassed 1.3 million in the UK alone, while client assets under administration (AUA) have surpassed £1 billion. Both those figures also mark a healthy leap over its as-of-Sept-2021 fiscal year end figures, of 886,742 registered users and £897.5 million in AUA. Freetrade is an app-based stockbroker, providing an execution-only trading platform to retail customers. Customers are able to purchase instruments listed on exchanges in the United Kingdom, United States and Europe, and hold these in either a General Investment Account (GIA), a Stocks and Shares Individual Savings Account (ISA) or a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). In order to offer commission-free trading and an ever-improving feature set sustainably, the company has built our own engineering system called Freetrade Cloud Platform that allows Freetrade to execute customer trades comparatively cheaper and faster than using third-party solutions. Overall trading volumes at Freetrade were more than three times higher in 2021 than the previous year at £3.3 billion (2020: £0.8 billion) as it added thousands of new stocks, exchange-traded funds and investment trusts across the financial year. The total value of assets under administration increased to £897.5 million (2020: £249.1 million) and as noted above shortly following the end of the financial year the total value of assets under administration surpassed the £1.0 billion mark. The number of registered users increased significantly during the year, increasing by 637,895 users and shortly following the end of the financial year reached the milestone of having over one million registered users. There has been a strategic investment in marketing activity to drive the strong levels of new customer growth in the year, including brand awareness campaigns alongside initiatives such as the successful referral scheme, offering a free share for each successful referral. In parallel with developing the products it offers to UK based users, the company’s recent fundraising has enabled Freetrade to begin expansion into international markets. During the financial year it established new locations in Stockholm, Brisbane and Vancouver to complement the existing London based team. Freetrade’s 2021 income statement follows:"

Moving forward, Atletico’s new shirt sponsor will be crypto exchange WhaleFin. WhaleFin recently finalized a new five-year, €210 million agreement with Atletico that will see the crypto company pay a whopping €42 million per year for the front-of-shirt rights. That more than doubles the current €17 million a year paid by Plus500 under its most recent deal with the club, signed back in 2017. The original Plus500-Atletico deal inked back in 2015 was a groundbreaking one for the online trading industry, setting the stage for the flood of sports sponsorship deals that followed by quite a number of brokers, which continues today. Until that time, most brokers spent their ad money (almost exclusively) online, while brand promotion and awareness was a fairly new concept for the CFD brokers. Plus500 itself continues to be very active with sports sponsorships, including Legia Warsaw, Atalanta BC, and BSC Young Boys.

Specifically, the SEC is looking to ban payment-for-order-flow (or PFOF, as it is known in the industry). PFOF is already banned in Australia, while the EU considers PFOF outside the parameters of its MiFID rules, although it has not explicitly been banned. Robinhood shook up the online brokerage industry in the US over the past half decade by offering commission-free trading, forcing its older established rivals such as E*Trade, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab to follow suit. The company was able to do so because it made money by selling its retail client order flow to market makers. Now, the SEC is looking to introduce new rules that will prevent the outright packaged sale of retail client trades, or PFOF. While an exact alternative model has not yet been mapped out, apparently the SEC wants a more competitive alternative, where individual (or group) client orders are auctioned off or competed for in some orderly fashion, guaranteeing the best price to retail traders on every trade. And that would put a serious crimp into the revenue stream of Robinhood, and some of the other commission-free brokers who rely on selling client order flow. “Helping out” the fall in Robinhood shares was some very negative sentiment generally in the equity markets last week, with the broad S&P500 index trading down by 5.1% over the past five trading days, including a 2.9% fall on Friday. At its current share price of $7.81 (Friday’s close), Robinhood is valued at about $6.8 billion – well above the $8.8 billion that rival eToro still, officially, plans to go public at via a SPAC merger. However those plans are likely to be altered or abandoned altogether, with eToro apparently looking at alternatives to its SPAC merger. Robinhood share price, July 2021 IPO to present.

Revenues in 1H-2022 came in at CHF 14.4 million (USD $15.1 million) at Dukascopy, up by 37% over the second half of 2021’s CHF 10.6 million, and also much-improved over the first half of 2021’s CHF 11.4 million. Net profit soared by 345% to CHF 3.9 million in 1H-2022, more than the CHF 2.3 million in profit Dukascopy showed for all of 2021. Dukascopy’s bottom line was helped by the company’s ability to keep operating revenues basically flat with 2021 levels, even as activity increased. Customer deposits at as 30/06/2022 were up slightly over 2021 year-end levels, CHF 123.3 million versus CHF 121.2 million. Dukascopy – which normally reports its financial in Switzerland semi-annually – took the fairly interesting (and unusual) step of releasing summary financial statements covering the first four months of 2022, through to April 30, 2022, back in early May. That May release gave us a good indication that 1H-2022 was going to be strong at Dukascopy, and as per above the company did not disappoint. Dukascopy is the second largest Retail FX firm based in Switzerland after Swissquote (SWX:SQN), which will be reporting its 1H-2022 results in a couple of weeks. The Bank and securities houses of Dukascopy Group are regulated in Switzerland, Latvia and Japan. The Latvian entity, Dukascopy Europe has a license to operate in the European Union.

This is one of the most requested features from Robinhoods advanced customers. With a cash account, customers can only use deposited cash or settled funds to make trades. This means advanced customers with a cash account can trade stocks, ETFs, and now options without worrying about their number of day trades. Options trading in cash accounts is a standard industry offering. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all customers, which is why all interested customers must apply for options access and have their account reviewed to determine if they are qualified. Customers who wish to trade options in a cash account can open the app and navigate to the Account tab → Menu → Investing → Day trade settings → Switch to cash account. On Web, navigate to Account → Settings → Investing → Account type → Switch to cash account. Over the past several months, Robinhood has launched important features and services for its most advanced customers. The list includes: Brokerage Cash Sweep: All eligible brokerage customers earn 1% interest on uninvested cash, helping them put their money to work and earn extra income. Stock Lending: By enabling stock lending, customers give Robinhood permission to lend out any fully paid stocks in their portfolio. Robinhood does the work of finding interested borrowers, and customers get paid when there’s a match. Options Trading Essentials YouTube Series: Because options trading carries significant risk, Robinhood launched this educational YouTube series to help people understand the fundamentals. Extended Hours Trading: As an important step towards one day offering 24/7 equities investing, Robinhood launched new extended hours that allow customers to trade from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on trading days. Shareholder Q&A: The service, powered by Say, is available directly within the Robinhood app. It enables customers to ask questions to the leaders of the participating companies that they invest in–right within the app. Options Rolling: There are a number of reasons a customer might choose to roll an options position, but typically the goal is to extend duration. This allows a customer to close a position (thereby realizing any gains or losses) prior to expiration while establishing a similar position further out in time. Note: you cannot roll options from a cash account."

The merchant services sector is ripe for disruptive technology which provides small to medium-sized businesses around the world with a fully democratized, decentralized network which empowers them to develop and expand their remit and be more efficient. Companies are used to long processing times, expensive transaction costs, and being beholden to large corporations led by shareholder interests instead of customer interests. We aim to change that for the better. I have all my career been an advocate of fair and proper business conduct in the FinTech industry, and that should be the whole ethos behind FinTech itself – to further the cause of user-friendliness and modernize the way things work. Therefore, it is a pleasure to be an instrumental part of this remarkable project and to work with some of the top visionaries within the decentralized financial services world.” The People’s SCE is a fully democratized ecosystem for merchants and vendors, as well as consumers, in which no central organization can take control. It’s a DGO, decentrally governed organization in which each user takes part ownership yet cannot have more than one share .

Article 22(1) of the Investment Services and Activities and Regulated Markets Law of 2017 (‘the Law’) as the Company does not appear to be in continuous compliance with the condition that is set out in article 17(2) of the Law regarding the organizational requirements with which CIFs must comply (establishment of appropriate policies and procedures). 2. Article 25(1) of the Law as the Company does not appear to act fairly, honestly and professionally when providing investment services to clients. 3.

B. Possible violation by the Company of article 30(2)(b) of the Law as it does not appear to control the activities of the SA to ensure that it continues to comply with the Law. Partial suspension of the Company’s operating license means the prohibition of providing / exercising investment services / activities in the territory of France, including the provision of services through the SA, which also means the following: 1. Prohibition of accepting new clients from the territory of France and concluding with those in a business relationship. 2.

Prohibition of receiving new deposits from existing customers from the territory of France, unless this concerns the exclusive case of covering the necessary initial margin of an existing open position and at the same time following their own express request. The above decision was taken on the basis of findings communicated to the Company by the competent supervisory authority of France, Autorité des marchés financiers (‘AMF’). The Company must, within two months, take the required actions to comply with the above provisions. Throughout the suspension of its operating license, as provided for in article 9 of OD87-05, the Company, if its existing customers so wish, may proceed with the following actions without being considered to be violating the provisions of article 9( 7)(a) of OD87-05: 1.

Under Mr. Mahmood’s ownership the company has been rebranded as 4T Markets, with the new website(s) as noted above going live in Q1-2022. 4T Markets is offering trading on MT4 and MT5, and seems to be targeting mainly an Arabic language market client base. As part of the new ownership’s plan to relaunch the business, 4T Markets has moved to a larger office and hired a full-time employee to take on the Compliance and Money Laundering Reporting Officer’s position. It has also outsourced the accounting and payroll functions to allow the Directors to focus on business development. New agreements with top tier service providers have been signed, and the company’s IT infrastructure has been rebuilt to accommodate the trading business of the company’s clients. These renewed arrangements have resulted not only in operational efficiencies, but also in reduced costs by opting to automate certain business processes. In addition to direct client trading, the firm has signed agreements with two brokerage companies who utilise the firm’s trading technology as White Label clients, creating a monthly revenue stream for the company. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, 4T Markets brought in Revenues of £119,044, entirely from the White Label clients mentioned above. 4T Markets booked a net loss of £271,466, up from a loss of £216,860 in fiscal 2021. During the year the company’s shareholder put in an additional £75,000 of capital."

This becomes clear from an order signed by Judge Victor Marrero of the New York Southern District Court on August 11, 2022. The order concerns the trader motion for reconsideration of a ruling that nixed his motion to dismiss the CFTC case. In light of recent Second Circuit opinions, the Court found that reconsideration is warranted to permit Gorman to file a full motion to dismiss. At the conclusion of the parties’ briefing on Gorman’s proposed motion, the Court will determine whether dismissal is warranted, and whether to modify the Court’s prior Decision and Order regarding the elements necessary to establish liability under CFTC Regulation 180.1(a)(1) and (3). Let’s recall that, according to the CFTC complaint, on February 3, 2015, Gorman III, trading from Tokyo, Japan for a U.S. affiliate of Nomura, engaged in a scheme to deceive and to manipulate the price of U.S. dollar interest rate swap spreads published on a screen displaying prices from a swap execution facility broker firm (SEF Broker Firm) in the United States – JBIC. Gorman engaged in this scheme in order to benefit the bank in a separate interest rate swap transaction with a bond issuer, the CFTC says. The trader argues that the CFTC’s Complaint is its latest salvo in a campaign to win judicial approval for a vast expansion of the law of market manipulation."

(NSC) and transfer it to Nomura Fiduciary Research & Consulting Co., Ltd. (NFRC) through an absorption-type company split, effective February 1, 2023. This business reorganization will have a negligible impact on the company’s consolidated earnings. NSC’s Index Operations Department develops and disseminates the Nomura Bond Performance Index (NOMURA-BPI), the Russell/Nomura Japan Equity Indexes, and other indexes referenced by a variety of asset managers, including pension funds. NFRC offers fund analyses and assessments, investment advisory services, and asset management consulting services for individuals and for pension funds and other institutional investors. The business reorganization will allow NFRC to leverage its interactions with investors in developing and managing traditional asset indexes and to provide clients with index solutions tailored to their needs, including through the development of ESG-related indexes and other customized indexes. In addition, because the index business is being placed under an entity independent from the securities brokerage, the reorganization also facilitates the conduct of index operations with enhanced neutrality, independence, and transparency. Index operations are an essential piece of asset management infrastructure, and by adding these operations to its existing asset management advisory function, NFRC will aim to provide its clients with even higher value-added services."

Saxo Bank is well capitalised, so there will be no primary issue of shares by Saxo Bank. The proposed Business Combination would comprise a secondary sale of existing Saxo Bank shares to DCAC for distribution to DCAC’s shareholders; and the subsequent delisting and liquidation of DCAC, with Saxo being the ongoing Euronext listed entity. DCAC is soliciting interest from its existing shareholders and other investors in the secondary offer. The purpose of the potential listing of Saxo Bank is to diversify its shareholder base, raise its profile and so further accelerate its growth strategy. Saxo Bank shareholders Geely Financials Denmark A/S and Sampo Plc intend to sell a limited proportion of their shareholding. Certain members of Saxo Bank’s board and senior management team, including its founder and CEO Kim Fournais, intend to acquire additional shares alongside DCAC, should the Business Combination proceed. The potential transaction values the outstanding shares of Saxo Bank (before a Business Combination) at a pro forma aggregate amount of at least €2 billion. Saxo Bank recently reported first-half revenue of USD $288 million and Net Profit of $41 million – both improved from 2H-2021 but down from 1H-2021 – meaning that the proposed valuation will be in the neighborhood of 3.5x annual revenue, and 24x earnings. Geely Group bought its original 51% stake in Saxo Bank in 2018 at a valuation for Saxo Bank in the €1.325 billion range, so an exit at €2 billion, if completed, would represent a healthy profit for Geely on its original investment. We’d also note that the announcement follows the failure of a similar transaction for rival FX/CFDs broker eToro. eToro cancelled its SPAC-IPO plans (for a US NASDAQ listing) in early July, although it was pursuing a much loftier valuation of more than $8 billion. No binding agreement has been entered into, and there can be no assurance that a Business Combination nor listing of Saxo Bank shares will be achieved. Kim Fournais, CEO & Founder, comments: “We have a strong ownership, which we hope to strengthen and diversify even further, with full confidence that Saxo Bank is heading in the right strategic direction. We are building a prudent financial institution that is part of the solutions needed in the future – and we remain committed to delivering on our ambitious growth strategy. With this, I am proud to invite new shareholders into Saxo and the exciting growth journey ahead of us.” DCAC co-founder, Edi Truell, comments: “We are thrilled to have identified Saxo Bank as a high quality financial services combination for DCAC shareholders. We look forward to bringing our shareholders aboard on Saxo’s exciting journey, which we believe should provide a very attractive investment” JP Morgan is acting as placement agent in connection with the proposed Business Combination."

(NASDAQ:HOOD) is partnering with Duke University’s Department of Economics to launch a financial education program for students and student athletes beginning with the 2023 academic year. This 4-year partnership is part of Robinhood’s Money Drills initiative that makes financial education coursework available for college students and student athletes across the nation. Through the Money Drills program, Robinhood will provide funding to support additional course sections of the Duke Department of Economics’ personal finance class and offer guest lecturers to discuss financial education. Graduating students who have a fundamental understanding of personal finance is also a priority for Duke. University of Memphis and Kansas State University are also signing on to be part of Robinhood’s Money Drills Initiative. “In this class, students will engage in practical learning activities to internalize the essentials of personal financial management,” said Professor Emma Rasiel, Teaching Director of the Duke Financial Economics Center. “In today’s uncertain financial climate, it has never been more important for our students to learn these skills. I’m thrilled to be able to bring these essential tools and concepts to Duke students in a course that is accessible to students who are remaining on campus during the summer months.” The course will operate every summer and be available to students who stay on campus at Duke; it is not restricted just to student athletes. For student athletes who decide to enroll, anyone can take the class no matter the student’s sport or gender. Professional athletes fresh out of high school and college are becoming overnight millionaires. Reports have shown that a number of professional athletes declare bankruptcy in just a few years. Nearly 16% of NFL players file for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement. And sixty percent of NBA players go broke within five years of departing the league. Female athletes are especially impacted, as their financial fallout can be harder than their male counterparts. Robinhood believes it is critical that all students and student-athletes learn about the basics of financial literacy."

(JPXI) will make SCRIPTS Asia, K.K. a wholly owned subsidiary through the acquisition of all its issued shares, subject to the approval of the relevant authorities. The sum of the acquisition is USD 20 million (JPY 2.9 billion). In addition to this, a conditional acquisition consideration (earn-out consideration) of a maximum amount of USD 15 million (JPY 2.17 billion) may be paid contingent on the satisfaction of certain criteria. Overseas investors are an important player in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) stock market, and there are great expectations from these overseas investors for the disclosure and provision of company information in English. In light of this, TSE has been encouraging its listed companies to improve their corporate value through constructive dialogue with global investors, while also working to support them in enhancing their disclosure, for example through the establishment in March last year of “JPX English Disclosure GATE.” SCRIPTS Asia is a start-up company which creates transcripts of investor events held by listed companies and translates them into English within a short time after the event, then distributes these to domestic and overseas institutional investors, securities companies, and the like. SCRIPTS Asia’s services are highly evaluated by overseas investors. In consideration of SCRIPTS Asia’s contribution to narrowing the information gap between overseas and Japanese investors through its distribution of event transcripts, TSE has been collaborating with SCRIPTS Asia to provide a transcript distribution service since 2020. In order to promote the further expansion of English disclosure, JPX considers supporting its enhancement through the provision of practical services as an important part of its role as a market operator, and hence has decided to actualize this vision through the acquisition of SCRIPTS Asia by JPXI.

MetaQuotes stated that regardless of iPhone versions and browsers, traders can fully manage their trading accounts using a mobile device (just not via a downloadable app, at least in the Apple environment). The company noted that the new MetaTrader 5 Web Terminal has become faster and more efficient. The application has not just been optimized — it has been redeveloped from scratch. The new core has enabled faster response to commands and greater operational stability. MetaQuotes stated that the web terminal is safe to use since all transmitted information is securely encrypted. According to MetaQuotes the new MetaTrader 5 Web provides a fully featured trading terminal from which users can: Work with demo and live accounts Receive any financial symbol quotes Execute trading operations in any financial markets Analyze symbol quotes using more than 30 indicators Use Economic Calendar data for fundamental analysis All these features are available from any mobile browser. The popular night theme is also supported. MT4 and MT5 alternatives Despite MetaQuotes’ efforts such as these, we understand that a large number of MT4 and MT5 brokers globally are continuing to look for and implement MT4 and MT5 alternatives for their iPhone using user base, fearful that the MT4/MT5 App Store ban is likely to continue indefinitely. MetaQuotes has not yet publicly commented on our other connected story, that no new MT4 and MT5 White Labels will be processed, a story reported exclusively here at FNG at the end of September."

Revenues were also stable as compared to the most recent six-month period, 2H-2022. H1 2023 Financial Highlights Net operating income of £153.5 million (H1 2022: £126.7 million +21% yoy). Trading net revenue was £128.4 million (H1 2022: £101.0 million +27% yoy). Investing net revenue was £20.8 million (H1 2022: £24.2 million -14% yoy). Operating costs (excluding variable remuneration) of £106.3 million (H1 2022: £83.1 million1 +28% yoy) and £115.6 million (H1 2022: £89.7 million1 +29% yoy) including variable remuneration. The majority of the cost increase reflects investment for growth across CMC’s investing and trading platforms. Regulatory total capital ratio of 610% (FY 2022: 489%) and net available liquidity of £254.2 million (FY 2022: £245.9 million). Interim dividend of 3.50 pence per share (H1 2022: 3.50 pence) with a total dividend for the year expected to be in line with policy at 50% of profit after tax. Operational Highlights Plans to grow Group net operating income by 30% over three years based on the 2022 results and underlying conditions, remain on track. Significant development upgrades delivered across existing trading platforms in H1 2023. These include enhanced FX liquidity functionality, new trading analytics, new pricing functions and enhanced onboarding initiatives. Further product upgrades on track for delivery in H2 2023. Expansion of CMC Invest continues. The recent launch of the UK investment platform, CMC Invest UK, which will see new product additions over the coming months, will be followed by the launch of CMC Invest Singapore by the end of FY 2023. Further regional expansion in New Zealand and Canada also being considered. Trading active client figures decreased by 7% although all regions saw an increase in revenue per client (+36% yoy) largely due to higher client income along with an increase in client income retention to 83% (H1 2022: 80%). CMC’s marketing focus on premium customers continues to act as a successful strategy for the Group. Operating cost guidance for FY 2023 remains unchanged at £215 million excluding variable remuneration. Ongoing GBP weakness and the rate of recruitment for the delivery of strategic initiatives could result in higher costs. Lord Cruddas, CMC Markets Chief Executive Officer, commented: “I am pleased to report another strong performance for the first six months of the year. We saw an acceleration in activity across FX and commodities in addition to the normal activity across our index flow during a period of heightened focus on monetary policy action around the globe and a pickup in market volatility and trading volumes. Against this backdrop, we are on track to deliver our three-year expansion initiatives aimed at driving higher revenues and diversifying our earnings. We remain committed to improving our offering across our core trading CFD and spread bet businesses, allowing our clients to access a wider range of products through our award-winning platforms. In our Institutional trading business, we continue to grow volumes as a non-bank liquidity provider in the FX spot market. I am also pleased to have launched our new UK investing business, CMC Invest UK. This move in the UK into self-directed investing marks a significant milestone for us and complements our already sector-leading stockbroking business in Australia. CMC Invest UK will see significant new product additions in coming months, enhancing the platform to include ISAs, multi-currency accounts, mutual funds, and SIPPs. The UK wealth market remains an attractive environment and we are on target to offer retail investors a market-leading solution for long-term investment and wealth creation. I am also excited about the ongoing geographical expansion of our offering into new regions like Singapore. We have committed to launch CMC Invest Singapore by the end of FY 2023. This will complement our already substantial business in Australia, where the migration of the approximately 500,000 ANZ Share Investing client base is set to be completed on time, by the end of this financial year. We are on a fast track to diversification, using our existing platform technology to win B2B and B2C investing business. Our strategic growth plans are on track and set to deliver significant new business expansion as we introduce new products across our retail, institutional and stockbroking businesses.” CMC Markets Outlook Regarding outlook, CMC said that its three-year growth plans remain unchanged and on track. New business expansion is expected to grow net operating income by 30% over the next three years based on the FY 2022 result and underlying conditions, with expansion in profit margins expected from FY 2024 onwards. The targeted growth is expected to be broadly linear over that period. New growth investment will focus on initiatives aiming to enhance functionality and capture a broader share of wallet as CMC evolves its execution services and investment platforms. The company will continue to utilise its technology to enter new markets and expand its investing offering. The impact of this growth and diversification will reduce revenue volatility in the medium term and grow pre-tax profit margins from FY 2024. In respect of operating costs, guidance for FY 2023 remains unchanged at £215 million excluding variable remuneration. Currency volatility still leads to some uncertainty over non-GBP costs although any sustained GBP weakness would have a net positive effect on profit due to non-GBP denominated revenue. CMC expects inflationary pressures to persist in H2 and the company continues to monitor the rate of recruiting success for the delivery of core strategic initiatives for the remainder of the year. Further expansion into the institutional space and the geographic expansion of the investment business is expected to cause some cost increases in FY 2024 when comparing against FY 2023.

We understand that Eurotrader has just been granted an FCA license for UK subsidiary Eurotrade Capital Ltd, enabling Eurotrader to begin providing services to residents in the all-important UK retail market. The new license also makes sense in that Eurotrader has brought on board a number of London based executives lately, including the hiring of group CEO Marcelo Spina this summer. Other hires have included Compliance head Martin Couper, former Valutrades exec Rob Collins as Head of Trading, and Mikahil Abdul Rahman as Head of Marketing. And earlier this month we exclusively reported that Eurotrader hired two Axi executives in London, adding Jack Beezer as Chief Product Officer and Ben Swann as CTO. Eurotrader CEO Marcelo Spina said of the new license: “The acquisition of this FCA license is another significant step in our strategy for growth in product offerings and geographic distribution. There are some exciting developments scheduled for the next 12 months and I am very much looking forward to announcing these additional products and services.” Eurotrader has been operating to date as a CySEC licensed broker, via Eurotrade Investments RGB Ltd. The group also operates Eurotrade SA (Pty) Ltd, licensed and regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in South Africa. The Eurotrader group was founded and is controlled by Dr. Ozan Ozerk."

There are six trading styles to choose from: Traditional; Bold; Diversified; Comfortable; On Trends; High-Tech. For instance, Forex and CFDs are among the products suitable for the Bold type of traders, that is, for those with nerves of steel. Swissquote describes this type of traders the following way: “You know how to handle stress. Humdrum routines bore you rigid. You live life at 100 miles an hour and you’re a bit of an adrenaline junkie. You’re the sort of person who’d agree to climb Nanga Parbat with no Sherpa. Well, almost. Basically, you know that to win, you need to take risks. And you love that challenge”. Stocks are for the Traditional type, whereas cryptos are for the High-Tech type of traders."

FINRA explains that broker-dealers advertise their daily trading volume in securities through Bloomberg and other subscription-based market data providers that use advertised trading volume to compile reports and rankings of broker-dealers by security. Overstatements of a broker- dealer’s advertised trading volume can therefore mislead market participants about which broker-dealers are most active or possess the most liquidity in particular securities. Between January 2014 and February 2019, Barclays Capital used a proprietary system to calculate the volume of the firm’s trades and transmit that information to Bloomberg to be advertised. This system suffered from several technology flaws which caused various errors that led to inflated calculations of the firm’s trade volume. The system then automatically transmitted these trade volume calculations directly to Bloomberg, which posted them for advertisement. The improper calculations that inflated the firm’s trade volume included: (i) counting trades that were subsequently canceled or corrected; (ii) counting transactions between Barclays Capital’s affiliates as if they were trades between the firm and non-affiliated entities; and (iii) double-counting trades executed in the market when there was a subsequent transfer of the same security in a riskless principal transaction. In total, Barclays Capital overstated its advertised trading volume in more than 4,500 instances, concerning more than 2,600 unique securities, by approximately 147 million shares. The firm corrected the above-described technology flaws by February 2019. Therefore, Barclays Capital violated FINRA Rules 5210 and 2010. Also, between January 2014 and July 2018, Barclays Capital’s supervisory system and WSPs were not reasonably designed to achieve compliance with FINRA Rule 5210. Barclays Capital’s WSPs addressed neither how the firm should calculate its trading volume nor how the firm should monitor its advertised trading volumes for accuracy. As a result, Barclays Capital failed to detect thousands of instances where the firm overstated its advertised trading volume. In July 2018, Barclays Capital implemented new WSPs addressing advertised trading volume. In addition to the fine, Barclays Capital consents to the imposition of a censure."

The FP Markets IB portal has been redesigned with business intelligence in mind, to help maximise transparency and ensure partnership success. The FP Markets IB program is one of the leading partners programs in the FX industry and is designed to remunerate and reward introducers and partners that refer clients to FP Markets. With the new and updated IB portal, IBs have access to view their clients’ traded volumes and Sub-IB networks, and the ability to produce bespoke reports using advanced analytics tools. Partners can closely follow the client journey from approval status to deposits and withdrawals, ensuring full transparency. Further features include: An advanced user-friendly Dashboard that provides a snapshot of latest and all time account activity. Data visualisation tools to view month-by-month performance. Improvements to the referral link function allowing IBs to choose from a variety of landing pages which meet their target market needs and help optimise conversion. Detailed visualisation of multilevel IB hierarchies allowing every partner to easily access their commission plans which are broken down per instrument category. The procedure of transferring rebates/commissions has been streamlined to ensure smooth and swift transactions, and a variety of withdrawal options are available to partners. A brand new marketing section has been added to the IB Portal to assist IBs in attracting new clientele through the use of marketing material available in multiple languages, Partners also enjoy direct access to the Partners Hub for all the latest news, interviews, and tutorials. Project Manager Kim Reilly stated: “Introducing Brokers rely on transparency, excellent reporting and marketing tools to effectively manage their referrals. It is essential that partners have a point of reference to view their generated rebates and the commission rates they receive. We have transformed our IB Portal and provided upgrades IBs will really enjoy. The redesign was guided majorly by our partners’ feedback. What we have delivered is enhanced business intelligence, providing them with reporting tools that are second to none so that every type and level of IB will benefit.” More on the new FP Markets IB Portal can be seen in the following video:"

Recent events in the forex market have shown that running a business with just one trading platform can jeopardise the business continuity of Brokers and White Label platform providers. Removing the most popular trading app from the App Store has created massive confusion in the industry. After MetaQuotes suspended sales of the White Labels for both MT4 and MT5 platforms, Brokers were forced to look for alternatives. We receive many inquiries from clients, not only novice Brokers but also those who own MT4/MT5 servers and are uncertain about future events (mainly that Google will follow Apple’s decision). They openly admit that they are considering our own Match-Trader platform and a cTrader platform developed by Spotware Systems. Therefore, we decided to make a comparison to help clients better understand the similarities and differences between the currently most popular alternatives to the MetaTrader 4 and 5 platforms. Bear in mind that we compare the platform we have developed in-house with Spotware’s solution based on our own information research. Similar, but not quite the same Both platforms are available as a Server Licence giving Brokers sole control over their platform, and a standard White Label solution, for smaller or startup Brokers looking for a fast and easy way to start their business. But here’s the first difference. Match-Trade Technologies, which owns the Match-Trader platform, offers both: WLs and servers. Spotware Systems, however, (same as MQ) only sells cTrader servers and leaves WL sales to other technology providers. The White Label solution offer We offer a Match-Trader White Label package in a Broker-as-a-service model. Meaning that you can actually buy a complete forex business with predictable costs. We only charge a fixed fee for 1000 active accounts (with an option to upgrade) that varies from $2000 to $3500. It’s as simple as that. There are no other fees based on setup, deposit or Broker’s turnover. Match-Trader White Label entails a set of tools that includes Forex CRM with Client Office (and IB portal), Match2Pay multi-crypto payment gateway, and Social trading feature, all seamlessly integrated with the platform. Moreover, acquiring a WL means access to a trusted liquidity provider, ultra-fast data feeds, and more. We have also added special features for WL Brokers, like individual sets of symbols without suffixes, markups included on the chart and time on the platform based on the Broker’s chosen timezone. cTrader platform offers an unlimited number of trading accounts. Regarding the standard offer presented to customers, Spotware charges Brokers a $2000 monthly fee (plus WL provider’s fee). It also requires a $5000 setup fee for a platform with separate branded apps. With its cTrader White Label offering, Spotware Systems provides Brokers with a Copy Trading app, the cTrader Automate tool, and cBroker, an administrative tool to manage the accounts and trading conditions. Setting up a White Label platform takes around five working days for both providers. The server licence solution offer The full server solution has recently been breaking popularity records. The Match-Trader server is offered in a Software-as-a-Service model. It means Brokers have access to the entire server and sole control over it. The server can be hosted in one of the most reliable and secured data centres chosen by the client (Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Server). The monthly fee is $10 000, and there is no volume-based or setup fee. The license comprises 30 000 live trading accounts (with the possibility to buy another 50 000 with a $5 000 monthly fee). We keep our system as an open trading environment that can be easily accessed via API. Our proprietary platform is already integrated with most distribution systems, market-leading CRMs and other 3rd party solutions. The wide range of APIs we provide allows our clients to easily integrate every application to create a complete trading ecosystem based on the technology they use or provide. What’s important, Match-Trade allows Brokers to host their database on their own server, which is then connected to the platform itself. This solution is essential to the companies concerned with the data’s security. There are no major differences in Spotware’s offerings. The cTrader platform was first released over a decade ago. Naturally, it offers multiple integrations. Using cTrader Open API, you can interact with API by using JavaScript and connecting every 3rd-party app. The pricing is structured differently, though. cServer contains an unlimited number of live accounts, and Brokers pay a volume-based fee of $5 per every million traded. The setup times are similar in both companies; the server setup takes up to two weeks. Branded apps for web, desktop, and mobile devices Both platforms are available on the web, desktop and mobile devices, giving Brokers their own branded apps and allowing traders to trade on the go. Match-Trader, developed using ultra-modern PWA technology, is the only omnichannel trading app on the market. Its interface adapts to the device, and all user settings are synchronised in real-time, which makes for the best trading experience. The app is also lightweight and works smoothly no matter the device it’s used on. cTrader is also available on the web, mobile and desktop devices but offered as a separate cTrader native mobile app (created using native Android and iOS design patterns, layouts and controls) and cTrader Web platform (HTML5). Web-version also makes the platform accessible from any device providing desktop-version-identical functionality (it requires an HTML5-compatible web browser). Great UI/UX design catered to Traders’ needs What sets Match-Trader and cTrader apart from the competition is their modern design. cTrader has an advanced widget-based interface, meaning each feature is a separate part of the platform. Traders can fully customise their trading space according to their specific needs by moving widgets or switching them on and off to create their own platform view. On the other hand, Match-Trader offers a thoroughly tested layout, ensuring the best possible trading experience. The app’s interface is very intuitive and user-friendly, making the app easy to use, even for novice Traders. For more options, Match-Trader developers created a set of interchangeable skins. Traders can choose the one with colours and layout that works best for them. Equally important, advanced features like top movers, market events, economic calendar, and automatic trading are placed in the widget on the Match-Trader’s main view. Everything traders might need is always at hand. A Single-Sign-On solution between CRM and the trading platform guarantees that only one login is enough to use both tools. Both platforms offer their users equally detailed charts with advanced analytical tools to help traders better understand market trends and forecast future changes. There are various indicators suitable for novice traders and experienced investors focusing on in-depth analysis using advanced functions. Algorithmic, social or copy trading Both platforms allow users to automate their trading, though in this case, cTrader’s offer is more complex. The cTrader Automate allows traders to build automated trading robots and custom indicators using the cTrader API and the popular C# language. For copy trading, Spotware offers cTrader Copy, a fully integrated cTrader feature that allows copying trading strategies, as well as providing one’s own strategies for copying by other traders. We also provide a Match-Trader API that allows connecting any trading algorithm. It gives traders endless possibilities but also requires some technical knowledge. But for, let’s say, less-skilled traders, there’s a Social Feed and Copy Trading mechanism built into the Match-Trader. Traders can copy chosen trades from professional money managers/signal providers or follow their strategies (with a chosen budget). They can verify the historical performance of money managers to check their profitability and unfollow their accounts at any time. Manager and Administrative apps Both companies also provide a full suite of management options to their server clients to ensure full control over their business. When choosing the Server License from Match-Trade, Brokers receive Manager and Administrative apps that allow them to control the whole trading environment and manage all of the clients’ activities and accounts; followed by Admin/Manager APIs to set configuration and call all manager functions from external apps. In addition to cTrader, Spotware Systems also offers an advanced cTrader Suite with a wide range of options to manage the back office. Match-Trade Technologies vs Spotware Systems No platform comparison is complete without taking a closer look at its developers. Both Match-Trade and Spotware are renowned technology providers, with the second one being slightly longer on the market (3 years to be exact). The main difference is that Match-Trade started its development by building an ultra-fast matching engine and an institutional platform Match-Trader PRO. In contrast, Spotware began by launching a retail platform. So comparing only the platforms’ ages doesn’t give a full view. Also, when developing our platform, we were providing MT4/MT5 WL bundled with our proprietary Client Office app & CRM, Crypto payment solution, Bridge and data feeds. That’s why today, we can offer Brokers comprehensive solutions to run their businesses. Regulated liquidity and crypto payments with FIAT settlements Another significant difference between the discussed offers is the connection to liquidity and Data Feeds. Match-Trade offers access to its own ultra-fast data feeds. Thanks to the strategic partnership with Match-Prime Liquidity, which runs on the Match-Trader PRO platform, we can also provide access to regulated liquidity on a Prime of Prime model. Spotware Systems offers neither of them. It is possible for Brokers to connect with several external providers with whom they can sign additional contracts. The Match-Trader platform is also equipped with Match2Pay Crypto Payment Gateway. It gives the platform a significant edge, as Brokers using the app can easily collect, exchange and convert cryptocurrencies. Traders can make instant deposits using a credit card or wire transfer. Now, with the support of a regulated entity, M2P UAB FIAT settlements are also available. As of today, cTrader has no payment technology embedded. It can be integrated via API, incurring additional costs and volume-based fees. Technical and Broker Support Last but not least is the support we offer to our clients. Acquiring Match-Trader, Brokers receive access to our support team, available 24/7 via different messengers. That means instant help in case of any trouble with the platform or the ever-changing market conditions. Spotware Systems also has an experienced support team who provide a comparable level of client support. If you want us to elaborate, our experts are happy to answer your questions and dispel any doubts.

Mr. Taran, aged 53, and the helicopter pilot were both killed in the crash. Monaco Life reported that the EC 130 helicopter left Lausanne, Switzerland, shortly after noon. Mr. Taran was in Lausanne attending to business at crypto trading platform YouHodler SA, where he was a board member. YouHodler is run by former Libertex management board member and fellow Russian expat Ilya Volkov. Mr. Taran was also an investor and board member of Wirex, a popular app-based crypto trading and wallet platform. The reported point of impact was on the Plateau de la Justice near the Roman road close to the Col d’Eze mountain pass, above the A8 autoroute just west of Monaco, where Mr. Taran resided. The weather locally was reportedly good when the accident happened at about 14:00. Monaco Life reported that an investigation into the cause of the crash has been opened. A deputy public prosecutor from Nice also visited the scene, and suggested that “foul play had not been ruled out” as the reason for the crash."

According to the CFTC, this is a textbook case of fraud and manipulation in the financial markets. The regulator argues that John Gorman knowingly engaged in a scheme to manipulate a U.S.-based market and hid the truth of his actions from his transaction counterparty. When confronted with his wrongdoing by the CFTC, Gorman lied, telling the CFTC under oath that he had, as requested, preserved certain relevant communications, when in fact he had deleted them. Gorman also lied to the CFTC under oath, stating that he used WhatsApp to communicate with work colleagues only socially, when in fact he engaged in conversations on WhatsApp not just about business transactions, but even about the very transaction at issue in this case. The CFTC says that his arguments to confuse these clear facts are of no merit, and, for all the reasons outlined in the Court’s prior decision on these issues, and the Court should reject Gorman’s motion. Gorman, at the time a managing director and U.S. dollar swaps trader on the swaps desk for Nomura in Japan, engaged in a scheme to manipulate the price of U.S. dollar interest rate swap spreads published on a screen displaying prices from a swap execution facility broker firm (“SEF Broker Firm”) in the United States. Compl. He is alleged to have engaged in this scheme to benefit the Bank in a separate interest rate swap transaction (the “Issuer Swap”) with a bond issuer (the “Issuer”), at the expense of the Issuer. The Issuer Swap was priced on a pricing call, on February 3, 2015, using a specific screen that displayed prices from the SEF Broker Firm, including prices for U.S. dollar interest rate swap spreads with a ten-year maturity. According to the CFTC complaint, Gorman knew that the Issuer Swap would be more profitable to the Bank if lower prices for Ten-Year Swap Spreads were displayed on the 19901 screen during the pricing of the Bond Issuance and Issuer Swap. Although he almost never traded through U.S.-based brokers of the SEF Broker Firm, on February 3, 2015, Gorman arranged to trade through a broker who worked at the SEF Broker Firm’s U.S. office. Gorman told another trader at the Bank in a text message from his personal cell phone that he did so to “move the screen the quickest”— i.e., to move down the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads displayed on the19901 screen, which would make the Issuer Swap more valuable to the Bank, at the expense of the Issuer. Gorman engaged with the head of the Bank’s swaps desk, by text messages on personal cell phones, before the pricing call. Gorman and the Desk Head discussed the fact that the market for Ten-Year Swap Spreads was rising and that there was a large amount of buying interest. They also discussed how far Gorman could move the 19901 screen down, given that market prices were rising. Gorman told the Desk Head that he, Gorman, thought he could get the screen down to 13.25 basis points,1 and the Desk Head advised Gorman not to “waste too many bullets,” trying to get the price to 13.25. Gorman responded that “I hate pricing these when momentum is against us. Takes all the fun out of it.” The Desk Head repeatedly suggested that Gorman should sell fewer Ten-Year Swap Spreads given the upward move of the market, including telling Gorman during the pricing call, “Don’t fight the spreads / The more you keep the better.” Selling fewer Ten-Year Swap Spreads would have been economically rational because Gorman and the Desk Head expected prices to rise (i.e., that they would be able to sell at better prices later). In addition, if prices continued to rise as expected, and if Gorman sold Ten-Year Swap Spreads before buying the Issuer Swap, Gorman would be selling low and buying high, guaranteeing that he would lose money on the Ten-Year Swap Spreads. In spite of the Desk Head’s direction (“Don’t fight the spreads / The more you keep the better”), Gorman timed his trading through the Broker during the pricing to move down the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads on the 19901 screen, in the opposite direction of where the market was moving. Gorman was not trading because he legitimately wanted to sell at the price levels he transacted at, but rather, in his own words, to “get the print” (i.e., set the quoted price at Gorman’s desired level), and those trades sent a false signal to the market concerning the supply of Ten-Year Swap Spreads. When Gorman stopped trading to move down the price of Ten-Year Swap Spreads on the 19901 screen, the price on the screen immediately rose and, for over 18 hours, did not return to the level to which Gorman’s trading had moved it for the pricing. When Gorman spoke to the Issuer during the pricing of the Bond Issuance and Issuer Swap and quoted the price displayed on the Broker Screen during the pricing call, Gorman did not disclose to the Issuer that the only reason a lower price was displayed on 19901 during the pricing call was because he had sold Ten-Year Swap Spreads to move the price down, that there were more bidders than sellers at the SEF Broker Firm, or that market prices had been rising as a result of the heavy buying interest. Gorman also did not disclose to the Issuer that he sold Ten-Year Swap Spreads during the pricing not because he legitimately wanted to sell at that price level at that time, but so the Bank could “buy” the Issuer Swap at a lower price; or that he was trading through the Broker in the United States because the 19901 screen was being controlled in the United States and thus his trading through the Broker would move the screen “the quickest.” Gorman’s trading had its intended effect, moving down the price of the Ten-Year Swap Spread on the 19901 screen. The manipulated price was used to price the Issuer Swap with the Issuer, resulting in a more profitable transaction for Gorman’s employer and a less profitable transaction for the Issuer. Gorman then sought to hide his misconduct from the CFTC. During the course of the CFTC’s investigation of Gorman’s manipulative trading, the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement sent Gorman a preservation request, asking that he preserve certain categories of communications on his personal cell phone. After receiving the request, Gorman deleted communications that were covered by the request, including communications on the messaging application WhatsApp. He then falsely told the CFTC—both via a May 1, 2019 letter from his counsel to the Division of Enforcement and in sworn investigative testimony before the CFTC on November 20, 2019—that he had complied with the preservation request. Gorman further lied to the CFTC in the course of its investigation when he claimed under oath that he only used WhatsApp to communicate with certain other employees of the Bank about social topics. Gorman argues that the Complaint does not state a claim for a manipulative scheme or attempted price manipulation because it does not plead the absence of any legitimate economic purpose for Gorman’s trading. The CFTC notes that Gorman has made this argument before. Faced with the same argument and case law, this Court held that the CFTC did state a claim for a manipulative scheme and attempted price manipulation. The regulator says that Gorman’s argument has no new persuasive force than it did when he last made it, and the Court should hold that the Complaint properly states claims for manipulation and attempted price manipulation. Moreover, his argument that his trades were legitimate hedging transactions intended to offset risk contradicts the clear allegations in the Complaint, and cannot be a basis for dismissal. The CFTC argues that the complaint properly alleges that Gorman made the following material omissions when Gorman twice quoted the price at 13.5 bps during the Pricing Call: (1) there were more bidders than sellers for Ten-Year Swap Spreads; (2) market prices had been rising because of heavy buying interest; (3) the only reason that the price of 13.5 bps was displayed on the 19901 screen was that Gorman traded to move the price down; (4) Gorman deliberately traded through the Broker in the SEF Firm’s U.S. office because that office would move the 19901 screen “the quickest”; and (5) Gorman was trading Ten-Year Swap Spreads to help the Bank buy the Issuer Swap at a lower price, and not because he legitimately wanted to trade at that price level at that time. The Complaint alleges that this information was material because “the Issuer would have considered what steps it could take to prevent the resulting lower prices from being used to price the Issuer Swap.” The Complaint therefore states a claim that Gorman violated Rule 180.1(a)(2). Gorman’s arguments to the contrary are of no merit, the CFTC says. The regulator requests that the Court deny Gorman’s Motion to Dismiss in its entirety."

RBC’s written supervisory procedures required employees to disclose their personal brokerage accounts to the firm. The majority of employee accounts were held at RBC or with certain outside broker-dealers for which the firm received electronic feeds of account statements that were then subject to an automated review process. In other instances, however, the firm received paper statements, which were manually reviewed for compliance with the firm’s pre-clearance, holding period, and watch and restricted list policies. For paper statements, the firm’s process included four steps: (1) tracking receipt of paper statements; (2) reconciling accounts for missing statements; (3) reviewing the paper statements; and (4) escalating issues for review. During the period June 2018 through February 2020, the firm failed to have in place a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, reasonably designed to timely review paper statements from employees’ outside accounts. For example, the firm had no prescribed timeframe to track, reconcile, and review statements. As a result, and due to the manual nature of the paper statement review process, personnel turnover; and outdated technology systems, as of February 2020, the firm had a backlog of approximately 8,950 unreviewed account statements, with some dating as far back as June 2018. The firm’s review of that backlog was not completed until February 2021. In addition, the firm manually tracked receipt of paper statements, had no system in place to notify the firm or employees that statements were missing, and had no procedure for following up on missing statements. As a result, in some instances, the firm did not receive paper statements for review. The firm’s process to review paper statements was also not reasonably designed in two respects. First, the manual review process did not include a review for trading ahead of material changes in research. Second, the firm’s written policies and procedures required that certain employees who purchased a security hold that security for at least 30 days before the security could be sold. The firm’s procedures required review for violations of this holding period policy. Although the firm’s review of electronic statements checked for compliance over adjacent months, the paper statement review consisted only of looking at purchases and sales that occurred within the same month. Accordingly, the manual review process would not identify a violation of the holding period when there was a purchase in one month and a corresponding sale within the 30-day holding period in the following month. Therefore RBC violated FINRA Rules 3110 and 2010. To settle the matter, RBC has agreed to a censure and a fine of $360,000."

A sentencing control date is presently set in the case for November 10, 2022. Because the defendant’s cooperation is not yet complete, the Government has requested that the sentencing control date be adjourned for approximately 90 days. The defense has consented to this application. Let’s recall that Konstantin Ignatov was arrested March 6, 2019, at the Los Angeles International Airport. He was charged with wire fraud conspiracy stemming from his role as the leader of an international pyramid scheme that involved the marketing of a fraudulent cryptocurrency called “OneCoin.” An Indictment also charged Ignatov’s sister, Ruja Ignatova – a founder and original leader of OneCoin – with wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering offenses. As a result of misrepresentations that Ignatov, Ignatova and others made about OneCoin, victims invested billions of dollars worldwide in the fraudulent cryptocurrency. OneCoin Ltd. operated as a multi-level marketing network through which members receive commissions for recruiting others to purchase cryptocurrency packages. This multi-level marketing structure has fueled the rapid growth of the OneCoin member network. Indeed, OneCoin Ltd. has claimed to have more than 3 million members worldwide, including victims living and/or working within the Southern District of New York. Records obtained in the course of the investigation show that, between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2016 alone, OneCoin Ltd. generated €3.353 billion in sales revenue and earned “profits” of €2.232 billion."

Saxo Bank’s Outrageous Predictions are the brainchild of Saxo Chief Investment Officer Steen Jakobsen (pictured above), and come at the beginning of December – and today is the day! While by Saxo’s own admission its Outrageous Predictions list is meant to be just that – outrageous – as well as provocative and entertaining, Saxo did point out that some of its previous predictions over the past 10 years have indeed to some degree come to pass, such as: UK seen leaning toward 2017 exit from the EU (Brexit) on UKIP election landslide (OP for 2015). Silver breaks golden shackles to rally 33% (OP for 2016). Germany enters recession (OP for 2019). S&P500 falls 25% from its 2007 high to 1182 (OP for 2008). Brent crude drops to USD 80/barrel as producers fail to respond (OP for 2014). Bitcoin triples in value, from the current $700 level to $2,100 (OP for 2017). So here, without further ado, is what the Copenhagen based Saxo Bank has released for this (really next) year. Enjoy! Saxo, the online trading and investment specialist, is releasing its 10 Outrageous Predictions for 2023. The predictions focus on a series of unlikely but underappreciated events which, if they were to occur, would send shockwaves across the financial markets as well as political and popular cultures. These predictions are a thought experiment in considering the full extent of what is possible – even if not necessarily probable – and, occasionally, they come true. Saxo recently released its list of correct Outrageous Predictions, which included the UK’s exit from the European Union. While these predictions do not constitute Saxo’s baseline forecasts for what will happen in 2023, all large market moves are brought about by something outrageous because a big market move requires a big surprise. In a world where central banks and governments are set to lose their battle with inflation, the risk is that markets will prove as outrageous as ever in 2023 and beyond. Commenting on this year’s Outrageous Predictions, Chief Investment Officer at Saxo, Steen Jakobsen said: “This year’s Outrageous Predictions argue that any belief in a return to the disinflationary pre-pandemic dynamic is impossible because we have entered into a global war economy, with every major power across the world now scrambling to shore up their national security on all fronts; whether in an actual military sense, or due to profound supply-chain, energy and even financial insecurities that have been laid bare by the pandemic experience and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The World at War The Outrageous Predictions for this year are inspired by the similarities between Europe today and the state of the continent in the early twentieth century. In 1910, Norman Angell wrote The Great Illusion, making the argument that there was no way Europe could become embroiled in a serious war again because mutually beneficial trade had ballooned to enormous proportions in the preceding decades of prosperous peace. Within ten years, Europe lay in ruins after a horrible war of attrition on stagnant fronts. Fast forward to 2022 and the situation rhymes, as many were shocked to their core by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Few could understand why Russia’s leader Putin would risk war casualties and consign his country to economic hardship after two decades of booming and highly profitable export-driven trade, mostly in extractive commodities industries – chiefly with Western Europe and the rest of the world. The Ukrainian invasion has brought a war economy mentality to Europe on a scale not seen since 1945. And it’s not just about the woefully inadequate military capabilities in Western Europe, but also about an industrial, Germany-centred model that has been rendered existentially challenged by Europe cutting itself off from cheap and plentiful Russian oil and gas. Three of the Outrageous Predictions for 2023 look at how Europe may respond to this predicament, one prediction eyeing the creation of an EU Armed Forces and another one spotting the political dysfunction taking shape in France and possibly accelerating us toward the next existential crisis for the EU. Finally, the UK could find itself suddenly far too small to pretend it can remain an independent actor in an abruptly much bigger world, as Saxo outrageously predicts that an ‘UnBrexit’ referendum is held next year. Saxo predicts that these war economies will be pursued by global powers. The US and China are settling into a war economy mentality as their escalating trade and technology rivalry continues. Satellite countries may find themselves hard pressed to stay unaligned in a ‘trade cold war’. From the response to Russia’s invasion to Ukraine, it is clear that any country without a long-standing military alliance with the US will find it unacceptable to remain vulnerable to the weaponisation of the global USD system. So, Saxo predicts that these powers hold a conference and agree a new reserve currency to avoid the USD system entirely. If Saxo’s thesis of the war economy proves correct in 2023, then persistent inflation is expected. If inflation is even modestly more than half of the peak 2022 rate by late next year, outrageous outcomes are nearly a guarantee. In 2023, investors could risk over-estimating the likely recession’s positive impact on inflation. With or without a housing and credit recession, a nation’s almost inexhaustible need to invest in the new priorities of the war economy will ensure a tilt toward more inflation risks. From securing long-term energy supplies to reshoring production to build local supply chains for vital goods and expanding military capabilities, any slowdown in demand from the private sector will be compensated, and then some, by public sector spending. And while central banks claim they are attempting to fight inflation, they don’t really want ‘too much success’ in doing so. That’s because in the long run, a heavily indebted sovereign will almost always reach for the slow bleeding default of inflation rather than austerity or outright defaults. The Outrageous Predictions 2023 headline summaries follow: 1. Billionaire coalition creates trillion-dollar Manhattan Project for energy In 2023, owners of major technology companies and other technophile billionaires will grow impatient with the lack of progress in developing the necessary energy infrastructure that would allow them to both pursue their dreams as well as address the needed energy transition. Teaming up, they create a consortium code-named Third Stone, with the goal of raising over a trillion dollars to invest in energy solutions. It will become the largest research and development effort since the original Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb. In addition to pure research and development efforts aimed at realising the potential of current and ground-breaking new technologies, the fund will focus extensively on integration as well, or how to combine new generation sources with the power transmission and energy storage infrastructure that delivers baseload, the Achilles’ heel of current alternative energy solutions. Market impact: the companies that partner with the Third Stone consortium and can help realise its vision soar in value in an otherwise weak investment environment. 2. French President Macron resigns The June 2022 legislative elections saw President Emmanuel Macron’s party and his allies lose their outright majority in Parliament. Confronted with a strong opposition from the left-wing alliance NUPES and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, the government has no other choice but to pass major laws and the 2023 budget by a fast-track decree – triggering the constitution’s Article 49.3. Nevertheless, bypassing lawmakers cannot be a way to govern in a democracy. He therefore understands that he will be a lame duck for the next four years and he will not be able to pass his signature pension reform. Following the example of Charles de Gaulle in 1946 and 1969, Macron unexpectedly decides to resign in early 2023. Macron’s resignation opens the door of the Élysée Palace to the far-right contestant Le Pen, thus causing a wave of stupefaction throughout France and beyond, and setting up the latest existential challenge to the EU project and its shaky institutional foundations. 3. Gold rockets to USD 3,000 as central banks fail on inflation mandate In 2023, gold finally finds its footing after a challenging 2022, in which many investors were left frustrated by its inability to rally even as inflation surged to a 40-year high. 2023 is the year that the market finally discovers that inflation is set to remain ablaze for the foreseeable future. Fed policy tightening and quantitative tightening drives a new snag in US treasury markets that forces new sneaky ‘measures’ to contain treasury market volatility that really amounts to new de facto quantitative easing. And with the arrival of spring, China decides to pivot more fully away from its zero-COVID policy, touting effective treatment and maybe even a new vaccine. Chinese demand unleashed again drives a profound new surge in commodity prices, sending inflation soaring, especially in increasingly weak USD terms as the Fed’s new softening on its stance punishes the greenback. Under-owned gold rips higher on the sea-change reset in forward real interest rate implications of this new backdrop. In 2023, the hardest of currencies receives a further blast of support from three directions. First, the geopolitical backdrop of an increasing war economy mentality of self-reliance and minimizing holdings of foreign FX reserves, preferring gold. Second, the massive investment in new national security priorities, including energy sources, the energy transition, and supply chains. Third, rising global liquidity as policy makers move to avoid a debacle in debt markets as a mild real growth recession takes hold. Gold slices through the double top near USD 2,075 as if it wasn’t there and hurtles to at least USD 3,000 next year. 4. Foundation of the EU Armed Forces Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought the largest ‘hot war’ to Europe since 1945, and the 2022 US midterm elections saw a strong surge in the right-wing populist Republican representation in Congress, with former president Trump declaring his candidacy for the presidency in 2024. In 2023, it becomes clearer than ever that Europe needs to get the union’s defensive posture in order, being less able to rely on the increasingly fickle US political cycle and facing the risk that the US will entirely withdraw its old commitment to Europe, perhaps after a Ukrainian-Russian armistice. In a dramatic move, all EU members move to establish the EU Armed Forces before 2028, with the aim of establishing a fully manned and deployable land, sea, air and space-based operational forces, to be funded with EUR 10 trillion in spending, backloaded over 20 years. To fund the new EU Armed Forces, EU bonds are issued, to be funded based on keys of each member country’s GDP. This drastically deepens the EU sovereign debt market, driving a strong recovery in the euro on the massive investment boost. 5. A country agrees to ban all meat production by 2030 To meet the target of net-zero emissions by 2050, one report estimates that meat consumption must be reduced to 24 kg per person per year, compared with the current OECD average of around 70 kg. Countries most likely to consider the food angle on climate change will be those that have legally binding net-zero emissions targets. Sweden has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2045, while others like the UK, France and Denmark are aiming for 2050. But a carrot and stick approach rarely works, and in 2023, at least one country looking to front-run others in marking out its lead in the race for most aggressive climate policy, moves to heavily tax meat on a rising scale beginning in 2025. In addition, it plans to ban all domestically produced live animal-sourced meat entirely by 2030, figuring that improved plant-derived artificial meats and even more humane, less-emissions intensive lab-grown meat technologies will have to satisfy appetites to help save the environment and climate. 6. UK holds UnBrexit referendum In 2023, Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt manage to take Tory popularity ratings to unheard-of lows as their brutal fiscal programme throws the UK into a crushing recession, with unemployment soaring and, ironically, deficits soaring too as tax revenues dry up. Public demonstrations break out, demanding that Sunak call snap elections because of the lack of a popular mandate. Amidst the economic ruin, polls even in England and Wales indicate second thoughts on the wisdom of Brexit. Sunak finally caves and calls an election, resigning to allow a new Tory profile to take charge of the battered party. Labour leader Keir Starmer, noting the popular support for a second Brexit referendum and the Lib Dems surging in the polls as they clamour for a new referendum, runs on a platform of non-alignment on the Brexit question but supports a second referendum to rejoin the EU along the lines of the David Cameron deal struck before the original 2016 referendum. A Labour government takes power in Q3, promising an UnBrexit referendum for November 1, 2023. The ReJoin vote wins. Market impact: after a weak performance in early 2022, GBP recovers 10 percent versus the EUR and 15 percent versus the CHF on the anticipated boost to the London financial services sector. 7. Widespread price controls are introduced to cap official inflation Inflation will remain a challenge to control as long as globalisation continues to run in reverse and long-term energy needs remain unaddressed. Nearly all wars have brought price controls and rationing, seemingly as inevitable as battle casualties. 2022 has also seen early and haphazard initiatives to manage inflation. Taxes on windfall profits for energy companies are all the rage while governments are failing to use the classic tool of rationing supplies. Instead, they are actively subsidising excess demand by capping heating and electricity prices for consumers. In France, this simply means that utilities go bankrupt and must be nationalised. The bill is passed to the government, then to the currency via inflation, and then we have the likely doomed effort by western officials to cap Russian energy prices from December 5. The intent is to starve Russia of revenue and hopefully cheapen crude oil export prices everywhere, but it will likely do neither. In a war economy, the government hand will expand mercilessly as long as price pressures threaten stability. The thinking among policymakers is that rising prices somehow suggest market failure and that more intervention is needed to prevent inflation from destabilising the economy and even society. In 2023, expect broadening price and even wage controls, maybe even something like a new National Board for Prices and Incomes being established in the UK and the US. But the outcome will be the same as it is for nearly every government policy: the law of unintended consequences. Controlling prices without solving the underlying issue will not only generate more inflation, but also risking tearing at the social fabric through declining standards of living due to disincentives to produce, and misallocation of resources and investment. Only market-driven prices can deliver improved productivity and efficiency through investment. Market impact: please see Outrageous Prediction on gold rocketing to USD 3,000. 8. OPEC+ and Chindia walk out of the IMF, agree to trade with new reserve asset Recognising the ongoing weaponisation of the USD by the US government, non-US allied countries move away from the USD and the IMF to create an international clearing union (ICU) and a new reserve asset, the Bancor (currency code KEY), using Keynes’ original idea from the pre-Bretton Woods days to thumb its nose at the practices of the US in leveraging its power over the international monetary system. Market impact: Non-aligned central banks vastly cut their USD reserves, US Treasury yields soar and the USD falls 25 percent versus a basket of currencies trading with the new KEY asset. 9. Japan pegs USDJPY at 200 to sort out its financial system As 2022 rolls into 2023, the pressure on the JPY and the Japanese financial system mounts again on the global liquidity crisis set in motion by the vicious Fed policy tightening and higher US treasury yields. Initially, the BoJ and Ministry of Finance deal with the situation by slowing and then halting currency intervention after recognising the existential threat to the country’s finances after burning through more than half of central bank reserves. But as USDJPY rises through 160 and 170 and the public outcry against soaring inflation reaches fever pitch, they know that the crisis requires bold new action. With USDJPY soaring beyond 180, the government and central bank swing into motion. First, they declare a floor on the JPY at 200 in USDJPY, announcing that this will only be a temporary action of unknown duration to allow for a reset of the Japanese financial system. That reset includes the BoJ moving to explicitly monetise all of its debt holdings, erasing them from existence. QE with monetization is extended to further lower the burden of Japan’s public debt, but with a pre-set taper plan over the next 18 months. The move puts the public debt on course to fall to 100 percent of GDP at the end of the BoJ operations, less than half its starting point. The BoJ policy rate is then hiked to 1.00 percent and all yield-curve control is lifted, which allows the 10-year rate to jump to 2.00 percent. Banks are recapitalised as needed to avoid insolvency and tax incentives for repatriating the enormous Japanese savings held abroad see trillions of yen returning to Japanese shores, also as Japanese exports continue to boom. In consequence, Japan’s real GDP drops by 8 percent on reduced purchasing power even as nominal GDP rises 5 percent due to cost-of-living increases, but the reset puts Japan back on a stable path and establishes a tempting crisis-response model for a similar crisis inevitably set to hit Europe and even the US eventually. Market impact: USDJPY trades to 200 but is well on its way lower by the end of the year. 10. Tax haven ban kills private equity In 2016, the EU introduced an EU tax haven blacklist identifying countries or jurisdictions that were deemed ‘non-cooperative’ because they incentivize aggressive tax avoidance and planning. This was in response to the leaked Panama Papers, a trove of millions of documents that revealed tax cheating by wealthy individuals including politicians and sports stars. As the war economy mentality deepens further in 2023, national security perspectives turn increasingly inward to industrial policies and the protection of domestic industries. As defence spending, reshoring and investments in the energy transition are expensive, governments look for all available potential tax revenue sources and find some low-hanging fruits in haven-enabled tax dodgers. It is estimated that tax havens cost governments between USD 500 and USD 600 billion annually in lost corporate tax revenue. In 2023, the OECD launches a full ban on the largest tax havens in the world. In the US, the carried interest taxed as capital gains is also shifted to ordinary income. The EU tax haven ban and US change to the carried interest taxation rule jolts the entire private equity and venture capital industries, shutting down much of the ecosystem and seeing publicly listed private equity firms dealt a 50 percent valuation haircut."

(TSE) and Osaka Exchange, Inc. (OSE) have taken a disciplinary action against SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. (hereinafter, “the Company”) and have requested the company to submit a business improvement report. TSE suspends SMBC Nikko Securities’ securities trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the proprietary account of the Equity Department during the period from January 16, 2023 through January 20, 2023. The Exchange also imposes a fine in the amount of JPY 300 million on the company. TSE has requested the Company submit a business improvement report pursuant to Article 19, Paragraph 1, of the same Regulations. The decision on this case was made based on the outcome of deliberations carried out by Japan Exchange Regulation. OSE has censured the company. OSE has also requested the Company submit a business improvement report pursuant to Article 17, Paragraph 1, of the same Regulations. With regard to ten issues of listed shares, SMBC Nikko Securities attempted to prevent their closing prices on the execution dates of “block offer” trading, which served as the basis for the trading prices in the block offers, from significantly declining from their closing prices on the immediately preceding dates, thereby maintaining their share prices at certain levels. To that end, in violation of the provisions of Article 20 of the Order for Enforcement of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, the Company made purchases and offers to purchase at a series of limit prices for the purpose of stabilizing the market prices of the respective shares The conduct in this case is found to be in violation of Article 159, paragraph 3 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. In addition, the conduct in this case is found to have been committed due to insufficiency in the Company’s control environment for transaction screening aimed at checking and preventing unfair transactions and in its control environment for governance aimed at ensuring strict legal compliance and appropriate business operations. The Company conducts transaction screening for transactions extracted based on standards such as those set by TSE by using its transaction trend monitoring system. If a transaction is found to have a risk of leading to violation of laws and regulations, etc. as a result of the screening, the Company takes actions, such as conducting an interview or giving a warning against the customer, etc. that has conducted the transaction (including proprietary trading), according to the contents of the transaction and the past transaction status of the customer, etc. Under such circumstances, transactions of eight out of the ten issues of shares in the conduct in this case were extracted by the system as those suspected of being unfair transactions. However, as the Company sets a standard to implement the measures when the transactions are conducted over two or more days, transactions like those relating to the conduct in this case, which are conducted only on one market day for each issue, are not made subject to the measures, even if they are extracted by the system. Moreover, the company conducts transaction screening for proprietary trading related to specific events, such as block trades, irrespective of whether it is extracted by the system. However, block offers are not made subject to the event screening, even though they involve similar risks as block trades, etc., such as there being an incentive to manipulate the closing price through proprietary trading. Accordingly, the measures were not implemented for any of the transactions relating to the conduct in this case. The circumstances above indicate that the company’s control environment for transaction screening is found to be deficient, and they constitute the circumstances provided in Article 123, Paragraph 1, item (xii) of the Cabinet Office Order on Financial Instruments Business based on the provisions of Article 40, item (ii) of the FIEA. Meanwhile, the circumstances above are found to be attributable to the company’s insufficient recognition of the risks involved in proprietary trading and other matters, as well as to the failure on the part of the company’s management team to respond to the increasing number of transaction screening cases by sophisticating the system and developing the transaction screening framework accordingly. Upon execution of a block offer, the company confirms the buying customers’ purchase intent in advance. In that process, a considerable number of the Company’s sales representatives provide such an explanation which allows buying customers to identify the execution date of the block offer. This situation is found to be giving an opportunity for customers who intend to conduct short selling on the block offer execution date to do so, and is serving as a cause that induces short selling. Since the time when the introduction of block offers was considered (in 2012), the Company had recognized concerns that buying customers’ short selling of the issue subject to the block offer would distort the price formation of the issue. However, the Company had commenced the block offer operations without appropriately discussing a desirable way of providing information to buying customers in relation to the block offer execution date and other matters within the company. Later, as the Company actually faced falls in share prices of the target issues on block offer execution dates, questions were raised, such as concerns about price formation. Nevertheless, the company has failed to take effective countermeasures against the concerns. The above-mentioned status of the Company’s business operations concerning block offers is likely to undermine market fairness, and is found to constitute a situation in which it is “necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors as concerns … business operations” as prescribed in Article 51 of the FIEA. The situation above is attributable to the fact that the Company lacked awareness as a gatekeeper of the market by prioritizing the promotion of its own business operations and hardly having the awareness to rectify the problems relating to its block offers, and that the company’s control environment for appropriately identifying business risks and challenges and taking effective measures, such as reviewing the product features, was insufficient. Therefore, the Company’s control environment for governance aimed at ensuring appropriate business operations is found to be deficient. Laws provide that a financial instruments business operator engaged in a securities-related business (limited to an operator engaged in a type I financial instruments business) must not receive from, or provide to, its parent corporation, etc. or subsidiary corporation, etc. any undisclosed information on the issuer, etc., unless the issuer, etc. has given prior consent in writing or by means of an electronic or magnetic record on the provision of such undisclosed information by the financial instruments business operator or its parent corporation, etc. or subsidiary corporation, etc. However, from January 2021 through October 2021, the Company received from, or provided to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, which is its “parent corporation, etc.,”, undisclosed information on corporate customers multiple times and shared this information within the Company, while recognizing that suspension of the information sharing was requested by or consent to the information sharing was not obtained from the corporate customers. The above-mentioned conducts of the Company are found to constitute the act prescribed in Article 153, Paragraph 1, item (vii) of the FIB Cabinet Office Order based on the provisions of Article 44-3, Paragraph 1, item (iv) of the FIEA. Meanwhile, the above-mentioned conducts are found whereby officers and employees of the Company prioritized the profit of the Company through obtaining deals, nevertheless recognizing that information cannot be received or provided between the bank and the securities company. Also given that executive managing officers of the Company are found to have been directly involved in receiving undisclosed information and sharing information with the persons concerned within the company, the above-mentioned conducts are found to be attributable to the fact that there is a lack of awareness of complying with laws and regulations, etc. in promoting bank-securities business relationships in the company."

He replaces co-founder and CEO Alan Schwarz who is leaving the company in what seems like an abrupt / unplanned move just after FXSpotStream exited its most successful year ever, establishing itself as a leading institutional eFX venue. Tom San Pietro has served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of FXSpotStream for the past six years, joining in 2017 after working as Head of FX/MM Trading Venues for Thomson Reuters, responsible for the firm’s anonymous FX exchanges as well as the relationship trading based streaming rates platform. He had also previously worked at FXall (prior to its acquisition by Thomson Reuters), LavaFX, and JPMorgan Chase. FXSpotStream’s clients include several of the FX/CFD non-bank liquidity service providers, as well as some of the larger brokers. Launched in December 2011, FXSpotStream eliminates the costs of execution for price takers and offers banks and clients the ability to interact bilaterally and in a fully transparent manner. Banks connected to FXSpotStream serve as Liquidity Providers to clients. Clients can access a GUI or single API from co-location sites in New York, London and Tokyo and can communicate with all Liquidity Providing banks connected to FXSpotStream. FXSpotStream also offers access to all of the Algos of the FXSpotStream liquidity providers over both its API and GUI, and supports pre- and post-trade Allocations. FNG received the following note from FXSpotStream on the matter: The Board of Directors of LiquidityMatch LLC, the parent company of FXSpotStream, is pleased to announce that it has appointed Tom San Pietro as Interim CEO of the Company. Tom is a senior executive with deep experience in developing and managing electronic FX trading systems and businesses. Following a successful career with technology vendors and major sell side FX trading technology departments, Tom joined LavaFX as its CTO and built the technology team that designed and developed an institutional FX ECN. After becoming CEO of LavaFX and growing the business substantially, Tom worked in partnership with the investment banking division of Citi to manage the successful sale of the business to FXall. At FXall, Tom served as head of product management. As a member of the senior management team, Tom helped the firm through a successful IPO and its eventual acquisition by Thomson Reuters. At Thomson Reuters, Tom led the effort to create the firm’s next generation FX trading desktop and trading APIs which integrated the FX trading capabilities of both Thomson Reuters and FXall as well as developing an FX aggregation strategy including EM and local market solutions for Russia, India, and China. Tom joined FXSpotStream as Chief Technology Officer in September 2017. Earlier in the day, outgoing CEO Alan Schwarz posted the following note on social media. Farewell… As some of you already know, February 1st will bring the end of my journey at FXSpotStream, a company I co-founded and led as CEO for over 11 1/2 years. Will keep the drivers for this moment to myself for now, but time to move on and very much looking forward to the next chapter. I am very proud of what we have built as an internal team at FXSpotStream. I have learned a great deal during this decade plus journey and have been fortunate to watch as people at the company have grown personally and professionally. We have been extremely lucky to have the support of so many clients and vendor partners around the world as we have built a truly great business and brand from scratch. I thank every one of our clients and vendor partners who have been with us for so many years. I must recognize our incredibly supportive FX margin brokers in Japan who were there in the very early days in 2011 and have never left us. I will always be indebted to their loyalty and for making me feel part of their family. And, for those banks that have supported our business, thank you for helping us become the leading global disclosed streaming service to the FX market. I wish only the very best to the global internal team at FXSpotStream. Thank you for your commitment and dedication to the company. Keep going and don’t let obstacles get in the way of doing great things! And, keep up the great level of customer support and responsiveness that we are recognized for in the market – it absolutely makes a difference! Afs"

Currently, the EBS Market orderbook uses 12 distinct contracts for trading End of Month NDFs (24 contracts, comprised of 12 ON SEF and 12 OFF SEF). These contracts have fixed expiry dates which do not change. Near the end of every month a new contract becomes active while the current active contract expires the day preceding the fixing of active contract. Upon implementation, this current model will no longer be available with the launch of the new contract listing model. With this change, NDF Expiration Date (tag 200-MaturityMonthYear) will be null. Currently, the fixed date for BRL EOM ON SEF and OFF SEF is two business days (BRL and USD Calendars) after the fixing date.

The news comes following what the company called 60% growth in 2022, surpassing £100 million in revenue, up from £63 million the previous year. We would note that the company seems to include pass-through activity in Revenue, such that DKK’s £63.9 million in “Revenue” came alongside £63.1 million in Cost of Sales, with Net Profit of £365,000. The company still files its financial statements under the Audit Exemption for Small Companies. As of January 31, 2022 DKK had £516,999 in Cash and Shareholders Equity of £355,199. The office, based in the Dubai World Trade Centre, will act as a central hub for DKK in the region granting greater access to the Middle East, Africa and Asia trade corridors.

Throughout 2022, the Receiver and his team have continued their efforts to recover and preserve the assets of EminiFX, Inc., as well as the assets of Defendant Eddy Alexandre traceable to customers of EminiFX, per the Consent Order. In 2022, cash receipts by the Receivership totaled nearly $65 million, primarily from the turnover of frozen funds ($60.9 million), as well as from the liquidation of vehicles and office equipment ($0.3 million), the recovery of various deposits from third parties ($3.3 million), and interest earned on the cash deposits ($0.3 million). Cash expenditures, for certain court-approved pre-receivership expenses as well as post-receivership approved professional fees and expenses, totaled less than $2 million, leaving a net cash balance of approximately $63 million at the end of 2022. In addition to the above cash receipts, the Receiver also recovered a substantial amount of digital assets (i.e., cryptocurrency), worth over $61 million at the end of 2022. The Receiver will continue to pursue all avenues of recovery. However, based on the current information available to the Receiver, it is likely that the vast majority of the funds that will be available for the Receivership, for the eventual benefit of creditors and defrauded investors, have been recovered. As noted in prior reports, the initial activities of the Receiver upon appointment were focused on winding down EminiFX  as an operating entity and preserving the EminiFX data and records. The Receiver’s initial decision to wind down EminiFX was based on the lack of any legitimate investing activity that would support the EminiFX returns paid to investors of between 5.00% and 9.99% per week. The prudence of the Receiver’s decision in this regard was demonstrated on February 10, 2023, when, just before the filing of this report, Alexandre pled guilty to one count of commodities fraud in the parallel criminal action arising from similar conduct. Alexandre also agreed to a Consent Preliminary Order of Forfeiture, which allows for distributions to investors by the Receiver to be applied toward the forfeiture amount. The Receiver expects to include more detail on the impact of Alexandre’s plea on the administration of the Receivership in the First Quarter 2023 Status Report. The Receiver and his team focused the majority of their forensic effort in 2022 focused on creating accurate financial records for EminiFX and determining the amounts that tens of thousands of individual investors had contributed to—and received from—EminiFX. That analysis has been significantly complicated by the lack of reliable financial records recovered from EminiFX, most notably the lack of a general ledger in any kind of generally accepted accounting format for the more than 100,000 transactions reflected in EminiFX’s bank statements and equivalent records. The database recovered from EminiFX has, however, been helpful to the Receiver’s forensic accounting team in attributing as many transactions as possible to specific EminiFX users. The reconstruction of these records is expected to be critical to the claims process the Receiver is developing, both in aid of validating the tens of thousands of expected investor claims as well as the Receiver’s planned efforts to minimize, to the extent possible, the burden on investors. Nevertheless, EminiFX investors should continue to maintain all of their records related to their EminiFX investment, especially those reflecting any deposits or withdrawals. Victims of EminiFX may consult this website for additional information about the Receivership."

This partnership comes at the launch of Trade Nation’s brand and website refresh, which has seen the trading platform develop its offerings for their clients who have a thorough knowledge of the markets and appreciate Trade Nation’s competitive spreads. Alongside a shift in their client focus, the brand refresh involves a new logo for the company which will be featured on the Wolves Women’s first-team sleeve, and in-stadium branding at Molineux stadium. Trade Nation is partnering with the team at an influential time in the team’s history. Women’s football has seen an influx of support in recent years, demonstrated during the Women’s Euros at Wembley last year which saw 81.5 million people tune in to watch. According to the FA, football is now the top participation sport for women and girls in England, and the support shown to women’s teams in recent years reflects this uptake. As the first FX trading partner of Wolves Women, Trade Nation are proud to be supporting the elevation of women’s football. The partnership with Wolves Women’s team compliments Trade Nation’s championing of women’s sports. Trade Nation CEO Stuart Lane said: “We are excited to witness the impressive growth of Wolves Women in recent years. Their hunger for success closely mirrors our own, and we are delighted to have the opportunity to work with this inspiring team for the remainder of the year. We couldn’t be prouder to display our new logo for the first time on the women’s shirts this season, and to bolster our brand recognition amongst a fantastic crowd.” Daniel McNamara, Wolves Women’s manager, said: “It’s fantastic to have Trade Nation on the journey with us. Their investment will go a long way in allowing us to continue to provide the best support for our women’s players to succeed.” “We are currently in a golden era for women’s football, and we have an ambition to make Wolves one of the most desirable clubs in the region for female footballers, so we hope this will be a long and successful relationship between our women’s first-team and Trade Nation going forward.” Trade Nation recently rebranded from Core Spreads, with the parent company rebranding from FINSA Europe Ltd to Trade Nation Financial UK Ltd, matching the new operating brand. Trade Nation and its various brands are controlled by UK entrepreneur Jasper White, who bought control of the company (then known as The Trader Management Company Limited) in 2014.

New users can now once again download the applications, and existing users can receive future updates of the apps. Late last September FNG broke what turned out to be the biggest FX and CFDs industry news story of 2022 – that Apple had removed MT4 and MT5 from its App Store. And after much (incorrect) speculation ensued on other FX industry “news” sites that the removal had something to do with MT4 and MT5 developer MetaQuotes’ connections to Russia (MetaQuotes’ founders are indeed from Russia, but have been residing outside the country for more than two decades with the company fully founded and based in Cyprus) FNG discovered and reported that the ban was due to increasing complaints to Apple from MT4/MT5 users who had accounts at the many offshore/unlicensed brokers that offer trading on the platforms to their clients. Those complaints of course had little to do directly with MetaQuotes. Indeed, many of those brokers had no direct business link with MetaQuotes, effectively renting an MT4/MT5 solution from third parties offering turnkey MetaTrader White Label solutions to (mainly) smaller brokers and those who want to start a new brokerage, without the outlay of expensive MetaTrader license fees, hosting, maintenance, etc. (More on that below). We also exclusively reported back in September that, in parallel, MetaQuotes had halted the processing of all new MT4/MT5 White Labels. Well it has taken nearly half a year, but MT4 and MT5 are back up on the App Store. We understand that over the past five-plus months MetaQuotes – which has remained fairly quiet on the subject – has been in discussions with Apple on the matter, with the company now demonstrating to Apple and the App Store folks that it was going to much more closely scrutinize which brokers can offer its apps – i.e. no more offshore or unlicensed brokers, whom as a group are infamous for mistreating retail clients and withholding client funds. It is worth noting that the past five and a half months have witnessed a virtual feeding frenzy in the FX/CFDs sector, with a number of MetaQuotes’ (smaller) competitors seeking to offer brokers an MT4 alternative for their Apple iOS device users. An entire sub-industry which had been built up around offering turnkey MT4/MT5 White Label solutions, as noted above, quickly pivoted to offering MT4/MT5 alternatives to brokers, and to those who wanted to start new brokerage brands. MT4 and MT5 have remained the dominant trading platform for Retail CFD traders, but what happened has indeed changed the industry and led many brokers to look to offer alternative platforms, not keeping all their eggs in the MetaTrader basket."

Pepperstone has a June 30 fiscal year end. On the bottom line Pepperstone UK saw profits more than double from £1.6 million in 2021 to £3.8 million (USD $4.6 million) in 2022. The company said that the growth of the business is evident in the revenue earned and number of client trends since Pepperstone UK started operating in 2017. It is also worth noting that 2020 had an exceptional revenue (£12.7 million) and profit (£6.3 million) due to market volatility in that year as a result of COVID19, but also that the company still had its European clients. The European clients now trade with other regulated Pepperstone entities, namely Pepperstone EU Limited, regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) in Cyprus, and Pepperstone GMBH, regulated by The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority in Germany (BaFin). Despite the European clients’ move, the Pepperstone UK has grown its revenue by 36% in 2022. As at the year ended 30 June 2022, the balance of client funds held within segregated accounts was £28.9 million (2021: £14.4 million). Pepperstone UK stated that it is fully committed to developing an offering that appeals to professional traders and retail clients who are generally more experienced and better informed about derivatives and financial markets than the average person. During the year the company launched more than 150 new products across various asset classes including shares, cryptocurrencies and ETFs. In total, the products on offer are in excess of 1,200.

(INV has a March 31 fiscal year end). Invast shares dropped to a 52 week low of ¥733 on Tuesday (May 30), settling to close at ¥735. At its current share price, the entire INV has a market capitalization of ¥4.32 billion, or USD $30.7 million. INV Inc operates Australia based Invast Global, in addition to its Japan based businesses that include Japanese online brokerage Invast Securities at website invast.jp, and a Japanese asset management arm, Invast Capital Management Co. In late April INV Inc reported its results for the year ended March 31, 2023, with the company’s Net Income falling by 75% from ¥808 million in 2022 to just ¥199 million (USD $1.4 million) in 2023. INV generated negative operating cash flow for the year, at minus ¥976 million (USD $7.0 million). The company’s operating revenue did increase from 2022 to 2023, by 16% to ¥6.0 billion (USD $42.8 million), but it appears as though expenses and cash spend far outstripped revenue growth during the past year. Due to the operating cash outflow alongside negative cash flow from investing activities, INV Inc saw its Cash levels drop in 2023 by 28%, to ¥8.22 billion (USD $58.5 million). While parent INV has been having its troubles, Invast Global has been spending and expanding its operations, with recent hires including CMC Markets executive Johan Koo as Head of Prime Services APAC, and BTC Markets’ Tiffany Besnard to head Hedge Fund Sales APAC. In late 2022 Invast bought GMO-Z.com, the UK operation of Japanese internet giant GMO, and earlier in the year the company expanded its EU operations naming Riana Chaili as CEO EMEA out of Cyprus. Regarding the coming year, INV Inc stated that the company does not disclose consolidated financial results forecasts due to the difficulty in predicting business results as the financial instruments business and asset exchange business are strongly influenced by economic and market conditions. Instead, the company provides operating revenue and other sales indicators on a monthly basis. FNG reached out to Invast Global management for comment, and received an official “no comment”.

NRI provides various financial services to Japan’s financial services firms. Through this partnership, regional firms in Japan will be able to leverage CTM, DTCC’s platform for the central matching of cash securities transactions, directly from NRI’s SmartBridge Advance offering to streamline and enhance the post-trade process, enabling users to achieve a shorter time to settlement and increased efficiency. In addition, the offering will include SSI enrichment from DTCC’s ALERT, the world’s largest database currently holding over 14 million standing settlement and account instructions (SSIs), increasing accuracy and further reducing risk. Prior to this partnership, many broker/dealer firms leveraged two separate platforms, DTCC’s CTM and NRI’s SmartBridge, for trade matching with Japanese firms.

The relevant documents, seen by FX News Group, were submitted on May 1, 2023 at the New York Southern District Court. This case arises from a July 2012 interest rate swap transaction between the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), a Japanese government instrumentality, and HSBC, one of the largest financial institutions in the world. In July 2012, JBIC came to market with a $2 billion bond offering that paid a fixed rate of interest at six-month intervals for a period of five years (at which point JBIC would be obligated to repay the principal amount of the bond). In conjunction with the bond issuance, JBIC entered into a $2 billion fixed-for-floating interest rate swap with HSBC. The economic terms of the JBIC Issuer Swap were determined on an audio conference call held between JBIC and HSBC on July 11, 2012. In this civil enforcement action, the CFTC alleges that Christophe Rivoire, a senior member of HSBC’s rates trading desk in New York, engaged in market manipulation and fraud in relation to the JBIC Issuer Swap. In brief, the CFTC alleges that Rivoire instructed a junior HSBC trader to manipulate the market for a particular investment product during the Pricing Call, and that Rivoire defrauded JBIC by not disclosing the alleged market manipulation. The core e of the CFTC’s case is a single line in a single email from Rivoire to Morgan Najar, the junior trader, a week before the Pricing Call: “So we’ll need to push the screen as much as we can before the pricing.” According to the CFTC, this email was an instruction from Rivoire to Najar to manipulate the market for a specific financial product, 5-year 6-month- 3-month basis swaps (“6s3s basis swaps”), at the time of the Pricing Call. Rivoire argues that the CFTC allegations are contradicted and disproved by a series of actual facts that have been established in discovery: When HSBC entered into the Issuer Swap with JBIC, the bank assumed $2 billion in basis risk. To fully hedge that risk position, HSBC was required to sell a total of $2 billion in 6s3s basis swaps in the broker market. On the day of the Pricing Call, Najar sold a total of $1.65 billion in 6s3s basis swaps in open-market hedging transactions. All of these transactions had the indisputably legitimate economic effect of hedging a portion of the $2 billion in basis risk that HSBC assumed when it entered into the Issuer Swap. Najar sold the $1.65 billion in 6s3s basis swaps over a multi-hour time period. Before the Pricing Call began, he had already sold $1.15 billion, and he sold a further $500 million during the Pricing Call. At the end of the Pricing Call, HSBC still had approximately $350 million in unhedged basis exposure. The prices of Najar’s hedging trades were determined, in all cases, by the normal forces of supply and demand. Liquidity conditions were excellent, and Najar’s trading caused minimal price impact. Even though he sold a total of $1.65 billion in 6s3s basis swaps on the morning of July 11, the prevailing market price actually rose during the time that he was selling. JBIC was a highly sophisticated counterparty. The JBIC Issuer Swap was executed pursuant to a written contract, known as an “ISDA Master Agreement,” under which JBIC and HSBC transacted on a principal basis and HSBC was not a fiduciary to JBIC. Rivoire stresses that the CFTC’s summary judgment submission fails to address what happened at ICAP. During the Pricing Call, representatives of HSBC and JBIC were looking at basis swap prices displayed on two broker screens that were maintained by ICAP, a leading interdealer broker. JBIC had insisted that these screens – known as “19905” and “USDBASIS” – would be used as the reference sources for certain inputs into a complex series of calculations that determined the price of the JBIC Issuer Swap. However, there were a series of technical breakdowns within ICAP on July 11, 2012 that resulted in inaccurate prices being displayed on the USDBASIS screen for part of the Pricing Call. The problems at ICAP caused confusion on the Pricing Call, as both HSBC and JBIC attempted to understand the gyrations they were witnessing on the USDBASIS screen. Frustrated by the inaccurate numbers on the screen, Najar berated Mike McDonnell, a broker at ICAP, during a side conversation that occurred in parallel to the Pricing Call. Ultimately, ICAP was able to correct the problem, and HSBC and JBIC agreed to go forward with the transaction. In its summary judgment motion, the CFTC alleges that Najar’s communications with McDonnell – both before and during the Pricing Call – were part of his efforts to implement Rivoire’s purported instruction to engage in market manipulation. But, Rivoire says, the CFTC runs into a series of facts: In 2012, ICAP brokers updated the USDBASIS screen manually, based on new transactions and price quotations. Because of the need for manual updates, as well as a design weakness that came to light in discovery, the screen sometimes showed inaccurate prices. During the Pricing Call, the USDBASIS screen malfunctioned badly because of yet another problem: a botched transfer of control of the screen from ICAP London to ICAP New York. Before and during the Pricing Call, Najar asked McDonnell to fix the problems with the USDBASIS screen, so that the screen would display current and accurate prices. In short, Rivore claims that ICAP mismanaged its broker screens, causing the screens to display inaccurate market prices. “This was entirely the fault of ICAP,” he says. Morgan Najar is the central actor in the CFTC’s narrative. And yet, the CFTC also fails to acknowledge critical facts about him that came to light during discovery: Prior to the JBIC Issuer Swap, Najar had only participated in one other issuer swap, and it had not gone well: he failed to execute enough hedging transactions, and he was saddled with a large, money-losing position for many months afterward. At the time of the JBIC Issuer Swap, Najar did not think he was being asked to participate in market manipulation, fraud, or other improper conduct. In 2012, Najar was disgruntled and unhappy in his job. He was prone to snarkiness and made disparaging statements about Rivoire’s French nationality. He received a poor performance evaluation for 2012 and left HSBC in early 2013. In 2017, Najar began cooperating with the CFTC in this investigation. He ultimately signed a declaration in which he stated that he interpreted Rivoire’s “push the screen” email as an instruction to “sell 5-year basis swaps at ICAP to lower the price of those swaps on the ICAP screens at the moment of pricing.” In his declaration, Najar stated that he “did a number of things leading up to and during the pricing” that he “would not normally have done,” such as trying to avoid selling 5-year basis swaps in the days leading up to the pricing call and trading through ICAP as opposed to a different interdealer broker firm. There are substantial reasons to doubt the veracity of Najar’s declaration, Rivoire says, including Najar’s bias against Rivoire and his desire to curry favor with the CFTC. However, even if Najar’s declaration is accepted as truthful for purposes of this motion, the CFTC’s case cannot stand, Rivoire explaims. The standard for liability is not a junior trader’s subjective interpretation of an email, nor is it whether he deviated from his purported “normal” practices (in a type of transaction with which he had virtually no prior experience). The test is whether the evidence fulfills the legal elements of market manipulation and fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. Rivoire concludes his motion by stating that he is entitled to summary judgment."

Shortly after the parties made it clear that they are far from reaching any agreement, Robinhood has submitted its opposition to the motion by the plaintiffs to certify class. Lead Plaintiff Blue Laine-Beveridge and the plaintiffs named in the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint had moved for an order certifying the following Class: “All persons or entities who held common stock in AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“AMC”), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (“BBBY”), BlackBerry Ltd. (“BB”), Express Inc. (“EXPR”), GameStop Corp. (“GME”), Koss Corp. (“KOSS”), Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. (“TR”), or American Depositary Shares of foreign-issuers Nokia Corp. (“NOK”) and trivago N.V. (“TRVG”) (collectively “the Affected Stocks”) as of the close of trading on January 27, 2021, and sold any such shares between January 28, 2021, and February 4, 2021 (“Class Period”)”. On June 7, 2023, Robinhood filed its response to the class certification motion. Robinhood insists that it was retail investors like the Named Plaintiffs who drove up the price of the specified stocks in a social media frenzy that created a bubble doomed to burst. During that frenzy, the prices for those stocks were completely untethered from the actual value of the underlying companies. This inescapable fact makes this case unsuitable for resolution as a class action, the brokerage says. According to the defendants, unlike in a typical securities fraud case for exchange-traded stocks, in which a defendant makes a common misrepresentation and the court can presume class members relied on it, Plaintiffs here cannot show that members of the putative class, including investors who did not trade on (and may never have heard of) Robinhood, relied on any statement Robinhood made regarding the reasons for its trading restrictions in deciding whether to hold or sell their shares of other companies’ stock. Nor can Plaintiffs establish that they relied on the integrity of the market. Robinhood argues that the evidence—including the sworn testimony of numerous Named Plaintiffs— establishes that many of the putative class members traded with full knowledge of black swan market events, attempting to take advantage of real or perceived short squeezes driving these stocks to their breathtaking prices. Predictably, the bubble burst and the stocks returned to their true prices. This coincided with Robinhood’s imposition of the purchasing restrictions, which all but one Named Plaintiff admit they knew about when they sold their shares. As with any bubble, some people made money and, depending on timing, others lost money. Plaintiffs now seek to certify a class of individuals who purportedly lost on their trades when the bubble burst. Robinhood notes that Named Plaintiffs lack standing to bring certain claims and are subject to unique defenses that preclude certification under the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(4). Discovery has shown that the proposed lead plaintiff, Blue Laine-Beveridge, is not a class member at all or at a minimum, he is atypical because he profited on his trades. Without a lead plaintiff, the class cannot be certified. Moreover, all of the Named Plaintiffs testified that they did not rely on the integrity of the market and instead engaged in unusual trading practices—such as not conducting research, trading based on price movements, buying and selling the same security in a single trading day and investing at the recommendation of social media influencers. These haphazard trading practices, which are not typical of all traders, give rise to unique defenses. Further, none of the Named Plaintiffs suffered losses from transactions in four of the Affected Stocks (BBBY, KOSS, TR and TRVG), so they lack standing to sue regarding those stocks. Finally, Robinhood insists that the Named Plaintiffs will not adequately prosecute the action as required by Rule 23(a)(4). Robinhood states: “Named Plaintiffs’ deposition testimony demonstrates that they have failed to take an active role in overseeing the case and do not even understand the substance of the action. In the most egregious display of a named plaintiff’s disregard of his obligations, one Named Plaintiff sat for his entire four-hour deposition while he was driving his car”. When asked to describe the putative class he seeks to represent, Mr. Gurney testified that the class is comprised of “human beings who have a complaint.” Robinhood requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification."

The multi-year agreement, marks one of the largest naming rights agreements in Japan and the Asia Pacific region. Once the marquee arena in Nagoya opens in 2025, it will be one of the biggest entertainment facilities in the country and has been designed to accommodate multiple types of sports, music, and family events. Located in the heart of Nagoya, the transformative IG Arena will be a cultural icon locally and regionally, fundamentally changing the live entertainment experience through a combination of leading infrastructure, cutting-edge technologies and a flexible footprint. Additionally, the arena will be the site of the 2026 Asian Games and Asian Para Games, which will be co-hosted by the Aichi Prefecture and the City of Nagoya. “We are thrilled to be introducing IG Arena to the world,” Tomoharu Furuichi, Japan Country Head. “This partnership is the perfect opportunity for us to drive awareness for our brand and marks a key step toward growing our market share in Japan, which is one of the fastest growing regions for online trading.” Furuichi continued, “The announcement also underscores our commitment to the Japanese market and our focus on investing in and delivering best-in-class technologies and platforms. With deep rooted ties to Japan, we share a commitment with Aichi International Arena Company, the local government and AEG to delivering innovation and excellence and believe that IG Arena will mark a new chapter for both fans and the city of Nagoya.” The historic naming rights agreement was brokered by AEG Global Partnerships and places the IG Group brand at the center of some of the biggest and most important sports and live entertainment moments set to take place in Japan. “It was important to us to find a partner who was an innovative leader that shared our ambitions for Nagoya and our vision to transform live events for Japanese fans,” Tokuji, Sagi, CEO and President of Aichi International Arena Corporation. “Delivering new consumer services to the market and a state-of-the-art fan experience will be at the heart of what we do at the arena.

The Type 1 license authorizes Nium to provide a wide range of financial services, including transferring up to 50 million JPY per transaction via Zengin-Net, Japan’s local payment clearing rail, to a Japanese beneficiary account. In 2021, an amendment to Japan’s Payment Services Act lifted cross-border transfer caps for Type 1 license holders, to lower the cost of money transfers in and out of the country. However, since this amendment passed, few companies have been able to meet the high standards for regulatory approval. As a result, businesses have had little or no choice but to use traditional high-cost, low-speed options for cross-border payments. Most other non-bank entities, including Money Service Businesses, hold Type 2 licenses, which limits cross border transfers to only 1 million JPY. Anupam Pahuja, Executive Vice President of Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa at Nium, commented: “Previously, only banks could transfer large funds, but today, Nium becomes the first true global alternative for large value transfers into and out of Japan. We look forward to empowering banks and businesses worldwide to do more commerce with Japan by providing the speed, efficiency, and transparency of payments that has long been missing from this important global market.” As Nium expands its operations in Japan, it anticipates fostering local partnerships and contributing to the growth of the Japanese fintech ecosystem. The company remains dedicated to building trust with its users and partners by prioritizing security, compliance, and customer satisfaction."

Effective today, the margin rate for new positions in TRY/JPY, CHF/TRY, EUR/TRY, USD/TRY, and GBP/TRY is hiked to 15%. There will be no changes to existing positions. The reason for the change are the upcoming local Turkish elections which are scheduled for March 31, 2024. Moreover, the Turkish central bank has recently raised the key interest rate to 50%. That is why, the broker has labelled the Turkish currency as risky. Please note that this change is temporary and will be reverted at IG’s discretion starting next week. The broker apologizes for the inconvenience and appreciates traders’ understanding."
